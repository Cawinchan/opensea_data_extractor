{"name": "Fishermen's shadows", "description": "I really enjoyed making this piece. Both digital work and painting. Before this one was a painting. And before painting was digital image, to be put in the painting. It was in 2010. when I painted this big painting, \"Almacn viejo\" mixed media on canvas, 200200 cm. Back then, MLIBTY shadows weren't born yet, at least not as they are seen today. Many details in this piece were photographed on fish boats. It is impressive how much fish are constantly being taken out of the sea. Seems that one day only fishermen's shadows will remain. MLIBTY Shadows are no ghosts. MLIBTY Shadows represent people. Characters are always in black & white, they have no hands and no legs, they are shadows with faces. MLIBTY stands for My Life Is Better Than Yours, which I take from one project I started in 2009, which deals with free distribution of an artwork, in the form of paper toys ( http://markozubak.com/mlibty).
