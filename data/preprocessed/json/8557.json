{"name": "Dreams of Mirror Earth", "description": "~~~~~~~~~~~ Based on a dream I had several months ago ~~~~~~~~~~~ Picture yourself standing on what seems like a ledge in orbit around Earth. However, you realize that ledge is connected to the ground hundred of miles below (or to the right from this vantage point). Ok wait, you're standing on the ledge parallel to the \"ground?\" Are we throwing basic physics out the window now? Looking out into the vastness of space, you're astonished to see what looks like a second earth not too far away. It's hard to make it out, but you see the shapes of landmasses surrounded by pure blue on this Mirror Earth, but wait... something's off. It hits you without reason and you suddenly understand that you're observing a reflection of Earth in the past. A cosmic visual illusion, a planetary mirage, the finite speed of light and its consequences has made you an observer of your soon-to-be home planet from hundreds of thousands of years in the future. You rush back through the apparent wormhole of a door that delivers you straight to the non-illusory Earth below. Why Antarctica? Of all places in the world? Antarctica? Hit with the immediate drop in temperature, you instinctively turn back to return through the door. It's gone, nowhere to be seen. Shivering, you realize you're not wearing shoes, but you feet feel numb to the ice and snow you're standing on. Looking down, you find that in fact, you don't even have feet.", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
