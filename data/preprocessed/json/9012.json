{"name": "Virtual Photography #2 (Crypto Art Show Debut)", "description": "Photographic document of one of the most innovative artistic events in Los Angeles. A bridge between the virtual and analogue, an art show that will bridge two worlds and effectively be global and yet street scene wise at the same time. While this VR show will take place, the other 'human' version will be taking place in Downtown Los Angeles at the same time. Interesting ponderings are ahead about how an art show can present itself and a question of the previous limitations it had before this movement began. Welcome to the crypto art movement Los Angeles, although you were late to the party I still love you all the same. - Robness(L.A. born and raised, beach bum for life) XOXO", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
