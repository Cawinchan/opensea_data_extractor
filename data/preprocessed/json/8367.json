{"name": "_004", "description": "Basis for this digital painting is sourced from a pencil drawing in a book I made. All drawings are completely improvised based upon various gestures and motifs I enjoy working with. Much of my work is inspired by music. While I am of the opinion that there are no direct correlations between notes and colours I like to think that this work uses green as a key signature for its colour composition. Total amount of time spent on producing this work took about 12 hours.", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
