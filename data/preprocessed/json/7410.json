{"name": "The Hemaphobe Vamp | Song A Day #728", "description": "\"I'm so hungry I haven't eaten for a thousand years I've cried a thousand blood red tears And i've wished I would die The tears fall and stain my feet Then I faint and hit the cold concrete I wake up and I'm still alive And the days go by It's a curse, it's a curse And it's ten times worse When they carried you out In the big black hearse And of course and of course The pale veiled maker Fed you the source but she made a mistake with you I'm so lonely I haven't loved for a thousand years Shunned by my people with a thousand jeers They just turn me away I've wandered far and I've learned much But all I want is to feel her touch To be reminded of better days When I was okay I'm ashamed A vampire afraid of blood It's a bad joke in a comedy club It's a movie plot Maybe I should write it down sell the rights and skip town Build a space ship and make a straight shot For some galactic parking lot\"", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello!
