{"name": "What My Self Reflection Froze | Song A Day #730", "description": "\"Is that really what I look like? Is that really who I am? That's not how I remember Me I just know that can't be right Are these my hands I'm seeing Is this body really mine? Where did all this come from? I'm lost in time tonight And i'm trying not to freak out at how fast each year goes But the mirror does not reflect what my self reflection froze Are these my steps I'm taking? My feet beat out a score Is that me I see running around? Playing less and working more and more? I remember being terrified I remember laughing hard I've been disconnected But never by this far before And i'm trying not to freak out at how fast each year goes But the mirror does not reflect what my self reflection froze Time passes gently So soft you barely feel A kiss upon your rosy cheek A touch that does reveal a ring One ring stands out alone Two rings join and meet A million rings fade to make A picture of complete living Song Request : A person who looks in the mirror but realises the reflection that she sees is not what she remembers. Nostalgia of youth.. Lol im not good at these suggestions but there you go soulfulentity 13 hours ago\"", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello! I'm Jonathan Mann!
