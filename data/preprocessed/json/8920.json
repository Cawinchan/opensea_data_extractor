{"name": "Dia de Muertos I", "description": "\"The Day of the Dead (Spanish: Da de Muertos) is a Mexican holiday celebrated throughout Mexico [..], and by people of Mexican heritage elsewhere. The multi-day holiday involves family and friends gathering to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and helping support their spiritual journey. In Mexican culture, death is viewed as a natural part of the human cycle. Mexicans view it not as a day of sadness but as a day of celebration because their loved ones awake and celebrate with them.\" (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead / [CC-BY-SA]) The work is based on a public domain image of a face-painted girl and part of my #dailyart (084) challenge.
