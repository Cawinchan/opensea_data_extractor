{"name": "To the Moon!", "description": "This is my first experiment of embedding a Bitcoin wallet inside an animated gif using steganography. Presuming SuperRare will not compress or alter the original uploaded gif-file, the collector will be able to extract the private key of the wallet loaded with 0.02 BTC. The public address of the wallet is: 13P3m4paqsBRSUWogY74QLSFfJMFXwx4yq The collector can use Terminal to extract the key like so \"unzip 2Moon.gif\". Windows users can also use WinRAR to decompress the zip (just rename the gif to zip upfront). To prevent the funds from being stolen, the buyer will need a password to unzip. This will be sent to the buyers Eth-address as an encrypted message using Mailchain. Alternatively I can send the password over Keybase chat (I'm shortcut there as well).
