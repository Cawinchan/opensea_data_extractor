{"name": "Virtual Photography #1", "description": "A shot I took in the decentralized blockchain world 'CryptoVoxels' before beginning the build of the very first Vaporwave(music genre) Virtual Plaza. The music genre itself is a paradox in the music world, some have called it simply downpitched 80's muzak whereas another view has come to terms that it isn't about the music but moreso the art that supplants the music. The biggest and most exciting artistic debate in the music field I believe has been in this 'Vaporware' genre of music, which inherently spawned from only one place.....the internet itself. This is an experiment in VR photography and documenting possibly the biggest shift in entertainment and the arts in human history.", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
