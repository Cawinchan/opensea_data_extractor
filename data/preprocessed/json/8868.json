{"name": "Palms", "description": "It was 2009, I was doing glitch art even before it was called glitch art. As always I was using printer errors, xerox copy machine, analog enlarging and so on. Xerox stuff, xerox art. Found in my archives. - Here is something more from 2009 about this piece: \"I collect everything... small pieces of bad prints... small stickers... photos... stuff... and after that I put all together in the xerox machine... This work is made up with some mis-prints of a work enlarged with rasterbator [https://rasterbator.net/] When I enlarged a work it came up that the printer had ruined all making all the dots strange and sliced as you can see.\" Original physical piece is A3 format 297x420 mm. Roovel said on this piece: \"Very solid effect as in -3D- There's a certain depth to it, certainly. The picture asked me to full view to go and seek these details, quite illusive. Always wondering how you make these, won't be this interesting if you tell me though.\"", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
