{"name": "TSP", "description": "The image is a self-portrait depicted using a solution of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The code has been written in R by Fronkonstin (@aschinchon). The TSP asks the following question: \"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?\" TSP is one of the most studied questions in computer science. It is known to be NP-hard, meaning that it is very unlikely that there exists an efficient solution for it. This is in fact related to the most famous open question in computer science, the P vs NP conjecture. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute, each of which carries a US $1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.
