That's Thomas singing with me.\" Snowballs are flying all over the place We kicked the snowmans head all around The snowman, he had a really good taser (Yeah) And thats why we had to knock him down Tom fell of the sled and he hit his head And then Mike ran over his head But he was dead Eager to split Leda chased after all of the snowballs She ran up the hill and bit the sled The sled started moving and she went with it She fell and landed in the great big snow bed She knocked the snowman down Knocked him all around And he fell with a great big sound Down to the ground Yah yoo yah yah x9 Yeah", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello!
