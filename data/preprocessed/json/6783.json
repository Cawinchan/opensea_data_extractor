In song!!\" Hello, my name is Alexey Pajitnov I like to play games Oh it really gets me off But where I live they dont like let you play Im a computer engineer I just sit and work all day One day while I was working an idea struck me there I saw those shapes afallin made up of four squares Aha! I know what joy that brought me I programmed it right onto my electronica 16 Well a friend imports the game to his IBM PC It sorta spurt around most unbeknownst to me It made its way to Budapest ??? 64 And thats when the problems start out more and more First theres Robert Maxwell whos working with Robert Stein They represent several companies and they want what is mine They get the computer rights but then I dont see a dime They come back for the arcade rights and I say, Not this time! Meanwhile Maxwells companies are going Tetris wild To Japan and North America, they spread the rights with guile But soon they made mistakes, granting overlapping rights The game is in the middle of an international fight Meanwhile, Nintendos making Gameboy and they need that killer app So Henk Rogers contacts Stein, but Stein dont give a crap So Henk flies to Moscow to get the handheld rights himself And then Stein hears about it and heads over there as well Well Rogers sees me first, I reckon right away I grant him the handheld rights, but he has more to say He shows me the game on Nintendos Famicon Which is being sold by Tengen, a clear violation Well Rogers is shock He got the rights from Stein Stein was being shady, and it wasnt his first try Rogers writes a check for every copy sold He proved to Mother Russia that he had a heart of gold At this point in the story, well the rest of you can guess Gameboy is released to unparalleled success Thanks in no small part to a game that we all love That game of course is Tetris, by me, Alexey Pajitnov", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello!
