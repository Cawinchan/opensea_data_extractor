He finds they are interesting, and decorative. d: Only this, professor B? B: No. Not only that... Mostly, the images magnified just appears pixelated. But in some cases, rarely, a motif appears. d: And is it interesting? B: Nothing that can distract us from the patenting fight, of course. But it's always the same motif, it's somewhat upsetting. Q: Can you tell me what it is? B: Look, this is it: . Probably it is an artifact, but it strongly remembers a drawing, or a fragment of word. d: And what does it mean? B: Frankly, we don't know yet. But I trust, we are close to understand it.
