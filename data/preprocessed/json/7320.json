{"name": "The Ballad of Teresa Lewis | Song A Day #634", "description": "Teresa Lewis was the second woman to be put to death by the state of Virginia since 1912. She died on September 23rd 2010. She allegedly hired two gunmen, trading sex for their services, to come into her home and kill her husband and step-son. She also allegedly offered up sex with her 16 year old daughter as collateral for the job.The point of this song is that no human, or group of humans, should be able to take another human's life. They just shouldn't. If she indeed did what they say she did, life in prison would have been an adequate sentence. Killing her solves absolutely nothing. Her daughter, the family member left to grieve, will never have a chance to fully forgive her mother. I find that the saddest part.", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello! I'm Jonathan Mann! I've been writing, producing and sharing a Song A Day for 12 years.
