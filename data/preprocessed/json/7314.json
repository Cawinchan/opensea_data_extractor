{"name": "Oprah Autotuned | Song A Day #628", "description": "Twitter: @songadaymann My second attempt at auto-tuning! Original video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnKfLVyHu_E I really love this video. The sheer joy and happiness is infectious. I found this video slightly easier to auto-tune, due to Oprah's voice being so clear (for the most part). I made the decision early on in the process (read: this morning) that I'd just attempt to auto-tune the screaming crowd as well. I'm not sure if that worked so well, but it's interesting for the song-dynamic. Oprah sings, crowd sings, kinda.\"", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello!
