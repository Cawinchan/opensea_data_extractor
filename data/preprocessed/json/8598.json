I was looking for inspiration for the #artproject bleedingedgetech Halloween competition (several 666$ prizes for variants of \"scariest <1min video/GIF incorporating a big Tech/Media company we love to hate\" ). This one spawned several elements that I've saved to separate files, so hopefully I'll find a way to use them in an entry to this competition.", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
