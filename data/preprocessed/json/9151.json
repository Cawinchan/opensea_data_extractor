{"name": "VK_Crypto said:", "description": "This artwork wants to capture a moment of history of Cryptoart on SuperRare. It refers to a post by VK_Crypto, one of the top collectors who believed and invested since dawn in Cryptoart. In this post VK_crypto replies with this phrase to an attractive bid (7 ETH) of another top collector of the moment, Moderats, on an artwork by Coldie. I find so significant this post that I wanted to immortalize it with an artwork because it marks the emergence of a secondary market and in particular the belief that Cryptoart can become a movement that will make art history.
