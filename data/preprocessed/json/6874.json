{"name": "Whiskey the Cat (And Other Songs) | Song A Day #00157", "description": "Jonathan from 2009 says, \"So, this is clearly a bit strange. The show that I was playing tonight was for Helenmae's cat, Whiskey who needs surgery. So naturally, I wrote Whiskey a song. But before I could sing the song, we had to get Helenmae into the room. So we sang her a song. So Ivory went to go look for her, and then we sang an Ivory song. And then, finally, we sang Helenmae a song. The only real problem is that you can't really see me, and someone was playing a tamborine right near the camera, so it's really loud. Anyway! Enjoy! (Oh, and the actual show went really well)\"", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello! I'm Jonathan Mann!
