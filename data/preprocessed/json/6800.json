This song is about The Employee Free Choice Act, which would make it much easier for workers to unionize. Which is a VERY good thing. Workers Unite!\" If I were fired just for thinking a thought My future threatened cuz the boss found out about me Handing pamphlets out in the parking lot To organize a union that was fair and free Tell me what country would you say that I was living in, darling You may be surprised to learn that I was living on your street, baby Baby, living on your street, baby This kind of thing, it happens every day People standing up and their bosses putting them down In fact, its in WalMarts DNA The managers job: to keep the unions out But I know that things are gonna change with the EFCA! There is no need to be afraid Cuz the workers will get their share! I said the workers will get their share Its been a long time coming I hear those drummers drumming I hear the workers rising I find that sound so moving I know that things are gonna change with the EFCA! There is no need to be afraid Cuz the workers will get their share! I said the workers will get their share", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello! I'm Jonathan Mann!
