{"name": "Night | Song A Day #00066", "description": "Jonathan from 2009 says, \"It's 1:30 am and I'm really tired and I wrote this song. NIGHT\" The night has come to put a spell on me Shes dressed me in her favorite shirt She makes me feel like a newborn babe Just do what she says and no one gets hurt The nights a moth thats greased with blood Executing butterflies for decadence Drunk with power and hungry for more On a throne made of unbroken plans The night scrolled graffiti on a bathroom wall All thoughts of me are ill defined The day paints over it with neon green But night writes on again every single time The night misinterprets my overtures Her silence a sign of her willingness But she comes too easily Though I see the beauty in this", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello!
