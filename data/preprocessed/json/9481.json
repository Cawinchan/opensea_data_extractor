{"name": "Omniset 1111:11(Christ Quadrants)", "description": "This is part of an abstract series where I experiment with enclosed gradient/radiance and interpret time spread in a larger galactic sync. This piece here, although not intentional turned into what resembles a cross and the planetary points that I made miraculously turned into the nail points on the cross of Christ. I will deem this religious art in the fact that I cannot avoid the symbolism therein. It is still abstract futurism but consider this a theologian piece as well if you wish. The other pieces are located at other notable blockchain galleries as well.", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
