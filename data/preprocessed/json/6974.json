{"name": "The Android Who Didn't Have a Penis | Song A Day #00261", "description": "Jonathan from 2009 says, \"this is a song about an android who is completely human in every way, except that his creators didn't see fit to give him a penis, or any other mode of sexual expression. As he grew older, it became more and more of a problem, until all he can think about is having sex. Ultimately, not having that outlet, he turns against his human creators, with all the years of pent up sexual frustration coming out in a fury of violence. It's a cautionary tale, to be sure.\"", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello! I'm Jonathan Mann! I've been writing, producing and sharing a Song A Day for 12 years.
