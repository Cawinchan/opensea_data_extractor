{"name": "From Satoshi to Shakespeare", "description": "As I was creating this piece an odd occurrence happened. I morphed our wonderful and humble subject Dorian Nakamoto(to which Newsweek misreported as being the creator of Bitcoin) through various figures and landed on my interpretation of Shakespeare. The odd occurrence is primarily due to the fact that the story of Shakespeare and the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto are linked dramatically in more ways than one. Shakespeare's identity has always been a topic in the dramatic art world and of course Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has been a constant drama that has lasted for a decade. Also they both were seminal at creating world defining works that changed the landscape of human civilization. The interesting point at hand is while working with artificial intelligence tools and yet guiding it generation by generation, I still feel the mystical force of art creation taking part and that this could possibly be a piece that was meant to be expressed. From Satoshi to Shakespeare, identities are what they appear to be....or not be.", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
