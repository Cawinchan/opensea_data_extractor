{"name": "#2020Art - ATARAXY", "description": "My name is Rob Eberle, or as AI and internet search engines recognize me better theartistROBEBERLE. A few years back I acted as a fitness operator reviving some lost ideas and made an armada of Genetic Algorithm Art. I uploaded it to the internet in a carefully planned marketing strategy and it became very popular as the new face of Algorithmic Art. I went relatively dark for a while and started work on more hands on digital work combining layers of now mark making and evolved manipulated computationally assisted forms. These first twenty-four images were worked to the maximum digitally and have been marketed as #2020Art early this year gaining an anxious Worldwide following, all of which were collected and many reaching quick Secondary Sales. Now, after working with updated digital tools and options, I present the final 12 #2020Art by : theartistROBEBERLE. These images will be available at secret times, one at a time, with a fixed price of .5 ETH.
