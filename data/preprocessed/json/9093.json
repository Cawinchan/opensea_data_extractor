{"name": "PEPELVIS", "description": "When the RarePEPE directory stopped issuing rares in early 2018 and decided to close the book on issuing new editions I did not have enough time to submit this. This Elvis Pepe has been sitting on my laptop for a couple years now and with Trump issuing support for the Hong Kong freedom protests I feel now it is time to release this since the energy is bursting over there. Elvis is the personification of America, The King of Rock n Roll and what better way to celebrate Hong Kong's future revolution than to release this once forgotten and almost NOT released rare. This is the last Pepe I ever made, it's sentimental but I feel it is one of my best. Go Hong Kong, rock the F out and show the world what a true revolution smells like...America+Elvis+Pepe+HongKong=PEPELVIS.", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
