{"name": "Watson and Jaws", "description": "Machines dont scare me, but sharks sure do! This reimagining uses machine learning to mashup two haunting images of the archetypal battle between humans and sharks indelibly etched in my brain since childhood. An anachronistic digital pastiche, the work combines John Singleton Copley's 1778 painting \"Watson and the Shark\" with a film still form Steven Spielberg's 1975 Jaws using neural style transfer and inpainting techniques. All profits from the initial sale will be donated by the artist to the World Wildlife Fund, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Eighty-four percent of WWF's spending is directed to worldwide conservation activities.
