{"name": "Bandcamp.com Anthem | Song A Day #00152", "description": "Jonathan from 2009 says, \"As it usually goes, when I find something I like, I write a song about it. Bandcamp.com! It's the best. I've been searching far and near for a good, simple, efficient way to distribute my music. And I have finally found it. I've started to upload everything, 12 years worth of material, to www.jonathanmannmusic.com (hosted by Bandcamp).
