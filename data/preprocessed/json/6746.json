Almost unfathomable amounts. Ugh.\" Up On The Mountain Top Song A Day #27 First note sung: D D------- Em------- G------- A------ 2X [verse] D I've been plagued by dj vu Em My dreams are all jumbled and they don't ring true G Dark clouds are gathering with storms of hail A Up on the mountain top D Throwing a rock down and watching it fall Em I feel like Peter but I look like Paul G I'm climbing around down on all fours A Up on the mountain top [verse] D Em Just a system of molecules G Subject to laws and rules A Beyond our control D Em Up, up on the mountain top G It's older than God Himself A It's older than time D Summer escape but will spring return? Em Will the sky go dark, will the valley burn? G Listen close, you can hear the melting snow A Up on the mountain top D I've been moved by ruined lives Em Nomadic friends and their silent cries G Shining out like a beacon to warn the world A Up on the mountain top D Em Just a system of molecules G Subject to laws and rules A Beyond our control D Em Up, up on the mountain top G It's older than God Himself A And it's older than time [bridge] Bm If you tell me what to do A I will follow you G If you tell me what to do A Tell me we'll make it through Bm If you tell me what to do A I will follow you G If you tell me what to do A If you tell me that we'll make it through D------- Em------- G If you tell me what to do A Up on the mountain top D", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello!
