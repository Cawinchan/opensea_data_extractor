He wanted a song about the \"Let's All Go To The Movies\" characters. I ended up writing a song about how pissed I get when I go to the movies these days, what with the 20 dollar tickets and the 20 dollar popcorn. It's all so over priced! No wonder.\" Lets all go to the lobby x3 To get ourselves a treat Fuck that, Im not going to the lobby Paid 17 bucks for this movie Im not paying 20 more for popcorn Go shove it up your ass Up your ass x3 And furthermore if my refreshments danced around And sang about me eating them Well that would just creep me out So Im bringing my own food You can try and stop me, but Im pretty fucking sneaky Ive got stir fry in my girlfriends purse Yeah I paid for this movie, but I sneak into other ones just as soon as this ones over And if I like it Ill go home and torrent it Yes I will I said fuck that, Im a vegetarian I wouldnt eat a sentient being Much less one that would dance around So cute it could be my friend Ill name him Choo Choo! And furthermore, your popcorn is slathered in butter Your employees dont wash their hands And your movies never start on time So Im bringing my own food You can try and stop me but Im pretty fucking sneaky Ive got some stir fry and curry in my girlfriends purse Yeah I paid for this movie, but I sneak into other ones just as soon as this ones over And if I like it Ill go home and torrent it Yes I will", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello!
