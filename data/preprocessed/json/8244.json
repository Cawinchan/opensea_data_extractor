{"name": "PumpAnon", "description": "Lifted from the popular Deplorables series, this artwork features an engraved portrait of Anon, behind bespoke typography. The Deplorables are the first legitimate banknote designs in the crypto space - both as NFTs and physical paper wallets. Anon is featured on the rarest of the series, and is also the most sought after. Unlike the original series, this high resolution, 600 dpi artwork allows the collector to view the engraving up close - every dot, dash and line. Engraved portraiture is a lost art form; it is only used with consistency in banknote manufacture. This single edition not only revives this rarely seen form of portraiture, but uses it to showcase a subject matter that would never be seen on money - until now!", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
