They Might Be Giants just released their 14th album, a kids album called \"Here Comes Science\". It's great! Anyway. During this podcast, they challenged They Might Be Giants to make a song up on the spot using the phrase, \"Quantum decoupling transition in a one-dimensional Feshbach-resonant superfluid\".

The lyrics come from an abstract that Sheey DE and Radzihovsky L. wrote on the subject in Sep. of 2005. I have NO idea what any of it means. I changed only one word...leaving out \"Luttinger\", because I couldn't figure out how to say it. Yay! \"", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello! I'm Jonathan Mann!
