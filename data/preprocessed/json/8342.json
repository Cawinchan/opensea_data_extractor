{"name": "Piu Caprim, The American Dream", "description": "\"In the Kayap language we call your money piu caprim, 'sad leaves', because it is a dead and useless thing, and it brings only harm and sadness. When your money comes into our communities it often causes big problems, driving our people apart. And we can see that it does the same thing in your cities, where what you call rich people live isolated from everyone else, afraid that other people will come to take their piu caprim away from them. Meanwhile other people starve or live in misery because they dont have enough money to get food for themselves and their children.\" - Raoni Metuktire", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
