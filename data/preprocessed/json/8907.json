{"name": "Gharaki the Ghoul", "description": "Gharaki took quite some time to come into their final form. I initially took a weavesilk image, passed it through Deep Style and found a symmetrical form in it... But then I decided that wasn't enough, passed THAT form through Deep Style, then cut out a small, nearly invisible pattern from THAT one, resized it from 100 pixels to 1000 (pretty much the current size) and Did some more Kaleidoscope pattern-searching, then worked it into a form I liked, animated it, and placed it on a non-symmetrical background. The non-symmetrical background is a result of how much I *love* the appearance of my Sad Stone Buddha artwork. The absence of perfect symmetry around the general shape of that artwork really brings into attention the actual form of the creature, which I think is excellent, as some of my past works have been... difficult... to separate from their backgrounds.", "collection_name": "SuperRare", "collection_description": "SuperRare makes it easy to create, sell, and collect rare digital art.
