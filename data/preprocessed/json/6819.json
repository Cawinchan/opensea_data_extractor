{"name": "Zombie Banks | Song A Day #00101", "description": "Jonathan from 2009 says, \"I don't mean to come off as overly harsh in this song...oh wait, I do. The banks as they exist now must perish! Community banks are the way to go! A bank that gives back, a bank that's not for profit. It's the only way to curb the insane greed.\" When dealing with zombies there are certain procedures you always must follow You always must follow Rule number one is go find a shotgun Aim for a head shot Aim for a head shot Now would you ever let a zombie survive? NO! Why would you do that? Seriously, why would you do that? What if you could study it and learn all kinds of things about it? NO! Just kill it! Havent you seen the movies? Weve got zombie banks with their toxic assets The bankers wont let them die But any horror movie aficionado can tell you that all the zombies must die So kill the zombie banks! Shoot them in their heads Then throw their corpses into the fire Too big to fail I say too big to live Lets start all over again", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello!
