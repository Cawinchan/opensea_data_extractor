{"name": "Robness - (Hold On)", "description": "This is cover art for a song I made that is now on Bandcamp/Soundcloud. I submitted to Blair Renaud, developer of 'Low-Fi' a virtual reality game based in a Cyberpunk world. Not %100 certain if it's gonna make it in the game but it's in development as we speak. I am submitting this to break the rules of what is currently known both in the art world and the music world. To fuse both mediums into one fine art aspect and be a concrete and rareified artistic medium in its own right. I present this piece as a truly objectified piece of artwork, that is both music and art at the very same time. The song is available for free to enjoy on Bandcamp, the visual element that you see here however.....is up to bid as a completion to the art piece as a whole. The first of many but here is my experiment in crypto, music and art as a whole presentation. Also could be the first foray into Gif music album art as well.
