He looks like Lee Harvey Oswald He's married to a chipmunk who's got a loose tooth and she looks kind of like John Wilkes Booth nothing sadder than a bald porcupine Who dresses up in nice clothes all the time Goes to the theatre to watch the ballet And get's assassinated Up there in heaven he's covered in slime But that's how it is there all of the time He walks around naked but with a toupet And no one calls him crazy I've got a headache and it won't go away I feel like Zach Morris at the end of the day You've got a headache and you feel lousy You're feeling kind of like kelly kapowski nothing sadder than a bald porcupine Who can't have nice things cuz he don't have the time who's got two left feet and wants to be dancing on the floor in the round out in the world they call him Moonshine He lives on a commune where they take out your mind they remove all the parts that identify fancy and leave you on the ground A song about a porcupine who is going bald Z0mbieGenocide 3 hours ago\"", "collection_name": "Song A Day", "collection_description": "### Hello!
