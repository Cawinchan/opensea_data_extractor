God? Is that it? God? Why I'll tell you... let me give you a little inside information about God. God likes to watch. He's a prankster. Think about it. He gives man... instincts. He gives you this extraordinary gift, and then what does He do? I swear, for his own amusement...his own private, cosmic... gag reel... He sets the rules in opposition. It's the goof of all time.
