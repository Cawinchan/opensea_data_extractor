The combination of those two elements is a metaphorical vision of the possible scenario of our future world.

In a high-profile 6 March 2014 article in the magazine Newsweek,[40] journalist Leah McGrath Goodman identified Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in California, whose birth name is Satoshi Nakamoto,[40][41][42] as the Nakamoto in question. Besides his name, Goodman pointed to a number of facts that circumstantially suggested he was the bitcoin inventor.[40] Trained as a physicist at Cal Poly University in Pomona, Nakamoto worked as a systems engineer on classified defense projects and computer engineer for technology and financial information services companies. Nakamoto was laid off twice in the early 1990s and turned libertarian, according to his daughter, and encouraged her to start her own business "not under the government's thumb." In the article's seemingly biggest piece of evidence, Goodman wrote that when she asked him about bitcoin during a brief in-person interview, Nakamoto seemed to confirm his identity as the bitcoin founder by stating: "I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection."[40][43] The article's publication led to a flurry of media interest, including reporters camping out near Dorian Nakamoto's house and subtly chasing him by car when he drove to do an interview.[44] However, during the subsequent full-length interview, Dorian Nakamoto denied all connection to bitcoin, saying he had never heard of the currency before, and that he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being about his previous work for military contractors, much of which was classified.[45] In a Reddit "ask-me-anything" interview, he claimed he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being related to his work for Citibank.[46] Later that day, the pseudonymous Nakamoto's P2P Foundation account posted its first message in five years, stating: "I am not Dorian Nakamoto."[47][48] In September, the account posted another message saying it had been hacked, raising questions over the earlier message's authenticity.[49][50] - Wikipedia  #2 from the "Rari Drop" Series  An evening image of Eiffel taken from trocadero.

Its kind of like my worst nightmare. Judgement." Before Song A Day, way back in 2003, I started competing weekly in something called [SongFight](http://songfight.org), a weekly song competition where musicians compete by writing songs with the same title. Elegy For Industry is the first Song A Day song that was part of SongFight. You can see all the songs from this fight [here.](http://sfjukebox.org/fights/elegy_for_industry). My song did not win. Jonathan from 2009 says, Song 4! Elegy For Industry. Strange. Kind of cheesy. Let me know what you think!" If you've spent as much time in airports as I have, you may appreciate this song. It was written and recorded while sitting in the JetBlu terminal at LAX while waiting for my flight to NYC. It was the first time I had run up against this problem: My flight was too early to do my song before,but I was arriving too late (because of layovers) to do it when I arrived. Song A Day gotta do what Song A Day gotta do. Another first: It was the first video I ever made for Song A Day! I was originally posting audio-only to Tumblr. Then I realized, "Wait, I know how to edit video!" and so it became a song/video every day. Also: There have been many subsequent Song A Day's written and recorded in airports. It's like it's own genre within song a day (which is why there's a topic of "travel".) Jonathan from 2009 says, Song #5 for Song A Day! I made it at LAX. In 20 min. While trying to not make too big a scene. Also got some time lapse of the gate I was waiting at. Yay!" As I describe in the beginning of this song, it was written and recorded on the floor of a bathroom of a tiny studio apartment in the West Village of NYC. My ex and I were staying with her mom and step-dad. Jonathan from 2009 says, " "Song # 7! A song I wrote today for Ryan and Matt and everyone else at 1up and EGM that lost their jobs yesterday. It's made me so unbelievably sad. First, they're my friends, and what they created and worked on, the 1up Show, was far and away the best gaming content anywhere, period. I'm going to miss my weekly dose of 1up Yours, 1up FM and The 1up Show, and boy am I going to miss getting EGM in the mail! Love! On to bigger and better things! All of you!" This is just a sweet little folk song sung in the stairwell. This was the very first Song A Day to ever go viral. It got posted to BoingBoing, a hugely popular blog at the time, and racked up over 50,000 views, which was A HUGE deal to me at the time. [Here's the blog post.](://boingboing.net/2009/01/11/folk-song-containing.html) This experience, of having a random song go viral, was part of what spurred me to keep going with Song A Day. If you've been on the internet for as long as I have, it might be fun to see some of the aged memes and popular figures I mention in this video. On the day that beeple hit 5000 everydays, I released this remix to celebrate. **Attributes** Mood: Happy. Genre: Remix Topic: Internet Location: Hartford Instruments: Vocals, Electric Guitar, Bass, Synth, Drum Machine Tempo: ~102.768 BPM Key: G Beard: Stubble Other tags: Fun, Silly, Internet, Motivational, Collab, Famous Person, Beeple Back in Nov. of 2018, I was very graciously (and to me, amazingly) invited to perform at DevCon4. My dream was to get Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, and a bunch of other Ethereum folks to perform a song with me. We made it happen! I decided to take the Vitalik portion of that performance and remix it together with some other footage of him speaking, as well as two other people: Dmitry Buterin, his father, and Vlad Zamfir, who has been part of Ethereum from the beginning. When I met Vitalik's dad at DevCon, it was the sweetest thing. He was just this proud papa. He was so into the idea that Vitalik had got up there and performed. That's how it felt, anyway. There was a real sweetness that stuck with me. The idea for Vitalik's part of the song was for me to list out a bunch of ideas that they went through for scaling Ethereum. Then, one by one, Vitalik would say about each, "That didn't work." In the original song, I list 4 examples, and for this remix, I really wanted 8 - to make the chorus longer. I found this [blog post] (://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html) detailing the "prehistory" of Ethereum, and it listed some more failed ideas, and one of them was "Vlad's rapidly evolving thoughts on reasoning about incentives of actors in consensus protocols and properties thereof". So that's why I decided to add in the part with Vlad. **Attributes** Mood: Silly Genre: Remix Topic: Ethereum Location: Hartford Instruments: Vocals, Electric Guitar, Bass, Synth, Drum Machine Tempo: ~185 Key: B Beard: N/A Other tags: Fun, Happy, Internet, Famous Person, Vitalik Buterin, Dmitry Buterin, Vlad Zamfir On August 16th, 2018, I put the call out on Twitter, asking for topic suggestions for my Song A Day. Gavin Purcell replied with [this tweet](://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1030207401239228416?s=20), asking for a song about how the Standford Marshmellow Experiment is bullshit. Two and a half years later, Gavin was posting to Twitter, inquiring about NFTs. It's always a big deal when someone I know starts poking around this space for the first time. I asked Gavin to set up a MetaMask wallet, so I could gift him this song. Maybe then he could post it for sale and make some ETH. Or not. It's up to him It's my sincere belief that the only way to really "get" NFTs is just by doing it. I met Gavin when I was an intern at the old cable channel, G4. He was my bosses boss. He's gone on to produce many amazing things like The Jimmy Fallon Show and Sarah Silverman's "I Love You, America". He's a super friendly, generous and creative guy. Thanks for being cool, Gavin! I'm happy to gift you your first NFT.  Jonathan in 2009 says, "While riding on the train from CT to NYC, I wrote this song about writing a song a day. Very meta. It's the anthem for anyone wanting to be creative!" Song A Day Anthem A D A D Pizza youre my favorite food just like the ninja turtles A D F#m E I could eat you everyday for breakfast lunch and dinner You promise me eternity with your perfect circle Ill never touch you with a fork, Ill always use my fingers A D Pizza is the best F#m E (pizza is the best!) Weve been truly blessed (Weve been truly blessed) By cheese and tomato sauce (By cheese and tomato sauce) Let us pray to the pizza gods (Let us pray to the pizza gods) D Oh pizza gods C#m we thank you for this bounty D Im gonna have 8 slices F#m E And I will eat them proudly Oh pizza gods We will free your cheesy sons From their corrugated prisons We will burn our tongues for you We will burn all of our tongues for you We will burn all of our tongues for Raphaele Esposito invented modern pizza In 1889 at his tavern in naples The Italian King Umberto and Queen Margherita Loved his pizza dish so much that it became a staple Pizza is the best Weve been truly blessed By cheese and tomato sauce Let us pray to the pizza gods Oh pizza gods We sing this simple truth: Bad pizza is still better Than any other food Oh pizza gods From slices down to crumbs Let not one scrap go to waste Well burn our tongues for you Bad pizza is still better than most other foods and If Im sad its pizza that will change my attitude Pizza was invented in 1889 The birth of pizza It was 1889 at the pizzeria di pietro There was Queen Margherita and King Umberto Raphele Esposito In 1889, Esposito who owned a restaurant called the Pizzeria di Pietro baked what he called "pizza" especially for the visit of Italian King Umberto I and Queen Margherita.Song A Day #11 D Em The thing about writing a song a day is that F#m Em some of them are gonna suck some are gonna be just plain mediocre but you shouldn't give up cause some of them will be just excellent like the best thing you ever wrote it's simple probability so listen to me note for note the thing about doing anything a day is you never know where you'll be today i'm on a train heading back for nyc but if you do the thing that you love to do and you stay interested you'll have a pile to show the world and you'll be glad that you did This is the first Song A Day that could be considered to be about social justice. Everyone's A Little Bit Queer Song A Day #12 First singing note: F# [verse] B F# Well, I could love a man G#m F# And right off the bat youd say B F# G#m F# Heres a list of things that he can and cant do now that I know hes gay! G#m F# But the things you do not know will make your head explode E F# F#7 Will plain downright confuse you G#m F# E F# F#7 For instance, what makes someone gay is just the same as all that makes you, you What Im trying to say here is that [chorus] B C#m G#m F# Everyones a little bit queer, from the Pope on down to the homeless beggar B C#m E F# B By now it should be pretty clear that everyones a little bit gay B F# I know it can be hard to swallow B F# E F# G#m E Especially for some that purport to follow Christ, or Joseph Smith F# You might just look inside your heart one day and see that Im right B C#m That everyones a little bit queer G#m F# From the president down to the lonely farmer B C#m E F# B Put aside all your fear, and listen to what I have to say [vocal solo] F# E-F#- B-F#- E-F#- B--- B--- [verse] B F# Well, a woman loves another woman E F# G#m F# And that seems kind of strange to you B F# E F# B But right then youre forgetting all the strange things that you do F# But wait a second! B F# The things I do, well, theyre not strange! E G#m F# Thats true! Cause thats who you are B F# You say, Im not queer, I like football and beer! E F# B But to me, thats a little bizarre E G#m But! Lets take this one step further, lets go behind closed doors E F# F#7 Lets move into the bedroom, with you and your lovers! B F# E G#m F# Maybe you like to have your nipples sucked, or do it doggystyle B F# E F# B Maybe you like to go down on someone who hasnt bathed in a while B F# E G#m F# Maybe you even like to take it up the ass sometimes with a dildo or some such device B F# E F# B Maybe you like public places or masked faces or role playing as Three Blind Mice E B Well, all of this is okay of course. No one here will judge you E F# F#7 As long as youre two or more consenting adults you can do what you do [chorus] B C#m Everyones a little bit queer E F# From the Pope on down to the homeless beggar B C#m E F# B By now it should be pretty clear that everyones a little bit gay E F# I know it can be hard to swallow B F# E F# G# E Especially for some that purport to follow Christ, or Joseph Smith F# But you might just look inside your heart one day and see that Im right [verse] B And heres what I think: F# E F# F#7 I think youre afraid of a man and a man together B You picture them touching F# It, oooh, it just makes you cringe E F# F#7 And from there you draw your conclusions B F# E F# F#7 You dress it up in words of god, but we all know that god said a lot of things B F# E F# F#7 And I cant speak to those, but what I know is that more love is a good not a bad thing [chorus] B C#m And everyones a little bit queer E F# From the president down to the lonely farmer B C#m E F# Put aside all your fear, and listen to what I have to say E F# I know it can be hard to swallow B F# E F# G#m E Especially for some that purport to follow Christ, or Joseph Smith F# F#7 You might look inside your heart one day and see Im right B And I hope so This song was deemed too dirty and sexy for YouTube. It got taken down and I had to reupload to Vimeo. Jonathan in 2009 says, "If you like sci-fi, robots, and sex, this is the song for you. Originally written for Monochrom's Arse Elektronika, I appropriated it for my Song-A-Day project. Contains lines like: "There was Data, there was Troi, in a sexual position called the Spock-McCoy." What Does It Mean To Love A Machine Song A Day #13 First singing note: F# Bm--- Bm--- Bm--- F#--- [verse] Bm D Well, what does it mean to love a machine? E Does it taste like metal? F# Does it taste like me? E F# If you love a machine, will it love you back? F# Will it understand Burt Bacharach?

Bm-C#m-D-C#m I said, Ouch. Bm-C#m-D-C#m I said, Ouch. Bm-F#-Bm-F#-Bm I said, Ouch. [verse] Bm D With my mind confused and my bottom sore E F# I walked through this big green door E Behind me the door disappeared F# A roomba rolled up and called me weird Bm D The whole room changed in a millisec E F# I was on some kind of holodeck E The voice said, Do you like Ayn Rand? F# A woman appeared, I took her hand Bm-C#m-D-C#m Bm-C#m-D-C#m Bm-C#m-D-C#m Bm-F#-Bm-F#-Bm [verse] Bm D Shes the most beautiful woman Id ever seen E F# Vagina smelled like a tangerine E F# I wouldnt have noticed in any case if it wasnt somehow right in my face Bm D E F# I understood without a word when in my mind I swear I heard E F# The sound of her breath, heavy and deep, and suddenly she was fucking me Bm D Well, I twisted and turned. I tried to escape E F# But theres no escape from robot rape E F# D E F# And just when I thought I could take no more, there was C3PO Bm D He took me down the long, dark hall E F# He brought me into a bathroom stall E He flushed the toilet, the floor gave way F# Bm-C#m-D-C#m I landed in a big buffet of balls Bm-C#m-D-C#m Balls Bm-C#m-D-C#m Balls, a buffet of balls Bm-F#-Bm-F#-Bm [verse] Bm D I was out of my mind. I was out of touch E F# A mountain of balls, now this was too much E I ran screaming through the crowd of mess F# I ended up on the observation deck Bm And there was Dada D There was Troy E F# In a sexual position called the Spock McCoy E Are you fully functional? they ask F# And I ran the other way when they slap my ass Bm-C#m-D-C#m Bm-C#m-D-C#m [verse] Bm D I ran til I could run no more E F# A door appeared that said hardcore E F# And next to that stood a door that looked like something out of a Roald Dahl book Bm D E F# And behind that door was a pneumatic tube, warmed by the sun and greased with lube E I stepped in there, despite my fear F# Bm-C#m-D-C#m And thats when I found myself here, with you Bm-C#m-D-C#m Bm-C#m-D-C#m Bm-F#-Bm Bm D So here I sit to tell my tale E F# You probably think that its an epic fail E Its a funny, funny song, sure, its just a goof, though F# We need evidence. We want proof Bm D Well if you look beside me youll see a jar E F# It looks empty, but it aint by far E Straight from my fairy godmothers crotch F# A nice fresh batch of nanobots! Bm-C#m-D-C#m Bm-C#m-D-C#m Bm-C#m-D-C#m Bm-F#-Bm Song A Day began, like Bitcoin, in the heart of the financial crisis. The title of this song: True story. And I NEVER get drunk. I'm Drunk Because The Economy Sucks Song A Day #14 First singing note: C# F# People lose their jobs, and they go get drunk B C#sus4 C# I like to get drunk with them because Im unemployed F# Man, I hope Obama can fix the economy B C#sus4 C# If hes just another politician Ill be annoyed F# But hes just a man Theres only so much he can do B C#sus4 C# The onus is on us now to break the back of greed F# Stab it through the heart Tear it limb from limb B C#sus4 C# Throw away everything but what we need B C#sus4 C# Im being held down by all of my loot B D#m C# F# And I cant help but see how I contribute to the problem But I dont wanna B C# But I dont know how to stop F# If everything collapses I will start a farm B C#sus4 C# Knowing nothing of farming except the early morning alarms F# Im overly romantic and woefully underqualified B C#sus4 C# Stuck between technology and a life simplified B C# F# And a life thats simplified This was written on the day it was first announced that Steve Jobs had cancer. This is the first of many, many songs about Apple, including eventually [the one] (://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFyXoPi9FNs) that Steve himself chose to open the AnntennaGate press conference with. Jonathan in 2009 says, "This one's about Steve Jobs. I have a weird internal relationship with Mac's in general, and Steve in particular. I follow Mac stuff obsessively, reading blogs, watching keynotes, the whole nine. But at the same time, I feel ashamed of myself for buying into the uber-super-duper consumerism of it. I mean, it's consumerism ULTRA. Then, with Steve, it's this feeling that, based on everything that I've read of him, based on all of the speeches I've read of his (and I've read most, I think), it just seems to me that someone of his intelligence and sensitivity must also see the raw, unyielding consumerism that he's the King of, and I wonder, does he care? Does he ever question what he's throwing his obvious talent behind? I wonder. Anyway, he's sick and it's really sad imagining a world without Steve Jobs. I hope he gets better. I'd be so curious to know what his inner life is like." Get Well Steve Jobs Song A Day #15 First singing note: C# F#--------------- [verse] F# D#m As businessmen go he is a legend C# B Surviving exile returning as king F# D#m If that sounds like Moses its no accident C# B The cult of Macintosh is a religion [refrain] A#m B We bow down to products that make us weep F# The beauty of simplicity C# The shepherd and his sheep A#m B We defend all attackers with fervent zeal F# C# In each operating system some new truth is revealed [verse] F# D#m C# B His violent temper, his strict beliefs, his singular vision makes him adored F# D#m And we try to please him as we make our way C# B Through the pipeline of products that we cant afford [refrain] A#m B F# C# I often wonder if he sees how our culture of consumerism has led to this state of the world A#m B F# C# And if he feels at all responsible for the ways in which Apple has fed D#m C# B F# But of course I frame these hypothetical debates around my own shortcomings D#m C# B C# Because I cant reconcile my obsession with Mac with all that I feel to be true [verse] F# D#m Steve Jobs is sick now and that makes me sad C# B For him, for his family, I hope he pulls through F# D#m The excitement that I feel when he walks out on stage C# B Its not just what hes revealing, but the way he reveals it, too [outro] F#------- Steve Jobs B------- Steve Jobs F#------- Steve Jobs C#------- 2X F# I've always kind of liked this song. The chord progressions is interesting. My iPod is frozen The old man is dozin The blue monkey goes in a hole The people commuting have guns that theyre shooting With erections saluting Bob Dole Riding the subway x3 Trains going faster than natural disaster With crumbling plasterfalls down A priest and his priestess are handing out leaflets That she is the cheapest in town Riding the subway x3 On automatic, cut through the static Like dust in the attic, I sneeze A dance and a scuffle, cries mostly muffled My iPod would shuffle and freeze Riding the subway x13 Is there an irony to selling an NFT called I'm So Tired of Capitalism? Maybe. Get used to it. I'm So Tired of Capitalism Song A Day #17 First note sung: F# D#m-B-C#-F# 2X [verse] D#m B C#m F# Swallow it up, swallow it whole D#m B C#m F# E Never be fresh or rest control away D#m---F#------ D#m B C#m F# Every new idea consume D#m B Price is right C#m F# E To will to bloom at somebodys will D#m---F#------- [chorus] B Im so tired F# Im so tired E Im so tired F# Im so tired B Im so tired F# Im so tired E Im so tired B F# Im so tired D#m---F#------ [verse] D#m B C#m F# Package it up, make it move D#m B C#m F# Transition is always smooth E And no one can resist D#m---F#------ D#m B C#m F# How can I grow if I know? B B C#m F# E All Ive shown is serves to throw me off of the track D#m---F#------ [chorus] B Im so tired F# Im so tired E Im so tired F# Im so tired B Im so tired F# Im so tired E Im so tired B F# Im so tired B Im so tired F# Im so tired E Im so tired F# Im so tired Of all of this crap B People often ask me, "What's your favorite Song A Day?" and I never really have an answer. And anyway, the more interesting question is, "What's your LEAST favorite Song A Day?" This song is definitely a contender. It's very sad to me because, as you can read below, I wrote this song after seeing a dear old friend perform, and I wanted to make a song for her and her band. But boy, did it not turn out right. The thing that bothers me most about this song is that I was *trying too hard*. All that being said, from an NFT collectible perspective, this song is actually quite rare. It's one of only 3 songs out of the over 4,300 I've written so far that was written in Baltimore. It's the first song that has a topic of "friend" (note the little picture frame in the image), and there are not very many of those, in the scheme of things, either. Jonathan from 2009 says, "I saw an old friend of mine yesterday, and she's starting a 3 person acapella group with two other gals. They sang me a song. It was awesome. This song is about them, and if they like and/or could do anything with it, it's theirs!" Love, magic, boyfriends, and Bushwick Thats how we came to be Love, magic, boyfriends, and Bushwick The 21st century The moon hung ove An iris Dakota Had some stranger on the dark side of the road In silence and light Three jewels of the night all dressed in white and shining No one saw, no one heard but the world knew without a word A clock strikes twelve, church bells ring And the night splits open, angels sing Love, magic, boyfriends and Bushwick Thats how we came to be Love, magic, boyfriends and Bushwick The 21st century Jonathan from 2009 says, "Written with Thomas, age 11, and Michael, age 8. They did most of the lyrics, I helped with the music. That's Thomas singing with me." Snowballs are flying all over the place We kicked the snowmans head all around The snowman, he had a really good taser (Yeah) And thats why we had to knock him down Tom fell of the sled and he hit his head And then Mike ran over his head But he was dead Eager to split Leda chased after all of the snowballs She ran up the hill and bit the sled The sled started moving and she went with it She fell and landed in the great big snow bed She knocked the snowman down Knocked him all around And he fell with a great big sound Down to the ground Yah yoo yah yah x9 Yeah This was written after a very long day of attending the inauguration of Barack Obama. That was the reason I was staying in Baltimore. Jonathan in 2009 says, "I went to the inauguration today. I'm too tired to write something coherent. Here's this instead!"

She brought me along on her ship We got to know each other along the way It was like looking into a mirror thats distorted and all opaque To make a long story short We made love in a castle Surrounded by the inhabitants of her universe And in nine months time, like some kind of miracle The rain returned Oh, the rain returned Oh, the rain returned And thats how I made love to myself in another universe And the rain returned Jonathan from 2009 says, "A great game!

Hello, my name is Alexey Pajitnov I like to play games Oh it really gets me off But where I live they dont like let you play Im a computer engineer I just sit and work all day One day while I was working an idea struck me there I saw those shapes afallin made up of four squares Aha! I know what joy that brought me I programmed it right onto my electronica 16 Well a friend imports the game to his IBM PC It sorta spurt around most unbeknownst to me It made its way to Budapest ??? 64 And thats when the problems start out more and more First theres Robert Maxwell whos working with Robert Stein They represent several companies and they want what is mine They get the computer rights but then I dont see a dime They come back for the arcade rights and I say, Not this time! Meanwhile Maxwells companies are going Tetris wild To Japan and North America, they spread the rights with guile But soon they made mistakes, granting overlapping rights The game is in the middle of an international fight Meanwhile, Nintendos making Gameboy and they need that killer app So Henk Rogers contacts Stein, but Stein dont give a crap So Henk flies to Moscow to get the handheld rights himself And then Stein hears about it and heads over there as well Well Rogers sees me first, I reckon right away I grant him the handheld rights, but he has more to say He shows me the game on Nintendos Famicon Which is being sold by Tengen, a clear violation Well Rogers is shock He got the rights from Stein Stein was being shady, and it wasnt his first try Rogers writes a check for every copy sold He proved to Mother Russia that he had a heart of gold At this point in the story, well the rest of you can guess Gameboy is released to unparalleled success Thanks in no small part to a game that we all love That game of course is Tetris, by me, Alexey Pajitnov Jonathan from 2009 says, "It's 1:30 am and I'm really tired and I wrote this song.

He and his wife were union organizers for 5 years. This song is about The Employee Free Choice Act, which would make it much easier for workers to unionize. Which is a VERY good thing. Workers Unite!" If I were fired just for thinking a thought My future threatened cuz the boss found out about me Handing pamphlets out in the parking lot To organize a union that was fair and free Tell me what country would you say that I was living in, darling You may be surprised to learn that I was living on your street, baby Baby, living on your street, baby This kind of thing, it happens every day People standing up and their bosses putting them down In fact, its in WalMarts DNA The managers job: to keep the unions out But I know that things are gonna change with the EFCA!

Obama, he takes the long view Hes a very astute public servant and he knows just what hes doing No!!! Hes just another politician Whatever happened to a team of rivals, for gods sake?! Oh I hate that term, team of rivals! But why Geitner?! Why Larry Summers?! Obama, why?! Obama closed Guantanimo And he started to return our moral standing on the stage of the world The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement?! Whatever happened to transparency?! What about warrantless wiretapping?! Why are telecommunications giants getting impunity?! I dont get it!!! Obama, why?! Obama does good Obama does bad Just like any other man But boy is he better than the last one we had We can all agree with that Yes we can Jonathan from 2009 says, "is a request from David Shuster, who has a show on MSNBC. He wanted a song about his show! So here it is! Wahoo!!" David Shuster can show you where the money goes When it seems for sure that nobody knows In the land of the bailout The curious man is king, oh Shuster likes to Twitter with the best of them Putting the screws to the guests when they wrestle him Hes the host of a show called 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Sixteen!

This is a REDUX, something I haven't done for any songs yet, but seemed appropriate here. This song is about following that which you LOVE to do. Since this whole viral Krugman thing only happened because I do what I love to do everyday, I want to spread the message of following your bliss, wherever it leads you. Hopefully this message will especially resonate with those that are out of work, down on their luck, feelin' blue and looking for hope. Find what you love to do and do it."

He wanted a song about the secret lives of Post-it notes. So here it is! Why is the post it note stuck to a building in NYC? Why, indeed!" Youre doing it right, Jon Stewart Youve been doing it right, oh, all along Though cable TV is a sewer You elevate it well beyond that Well, I recall the year was 2004 I was watching Crossfire, I was pretty bored When on walked Jon Stewart He had something important to say And he said, Stop hurting America And he meant it! Stop hurting America! The most brazen display of emotion since Jack Paar I had never seen someone be so real on TV before And it made me jump for joy to know that someone could Well, I dont believe that its a stretch To say the lasts eight years could have broken our backs In fact, Im sure you even saved some lives People contemplating Bush and suicide If not for your show, your ability to turn what everyone is thinking into comedy And isnt that whats kept us Jews around? I mean, going through hell and then laughing about it So youre doing it right, Jon Stewart You were doing it right, oh, all along From a hopelessly devoted viewer I humbly offer you this song here Jonathan from 2009 says, "This is a request from Joel Eckel and his son, Soren, who is 8 years old. Soren is following the song a day project closely, as it's become part of his daily home schooling curriculum. This is a song for him!" Jonathan from 2009 says, "WARNING! NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS!!! #90 is a song for a Jerry Springer song contest. The prize is $5000. Sweet. They're going to choose 10 finalists, then there will be voting by the public. The top 3 will come on the show and perform, and then a winner will be announced. 2 things about Jerry Springer that make me think there's more to the man than he gets credit for. 1. He was the mayor of Cincinnati. Then he slept with a prostitute. But he was HONEST about it, and was able to get elected a second time. 2. He was just a little baby when his parents bundled him up, and left their home in Germany to escape the Nazis.. His entire family tree was decimated. I think this colors the man." Look at Oedipus Rex Upon which all dramas based on Incest and violence, yeah, thats how it goes Look at the Bible! Look at Shakespeare! Youll find the human condition gloriously hideous Just like the Jerry Springer show Hideous because there is ugliness in all of us And its scary to confront that sometimes Glorious because, well, were all in this together And for each ounce of ugliness there is goodness multiplied I wanna see more kissing cousins More violent hillbillies More hard luck prostitutes And the guys that sleep with their girlfriends moms If most TV is ego, Jerry Springers the id The ultimate expression of all thats deep down So I say: Jerry Springer Oh yeah Jerry Springer, oh yeah x3 Jonathan from 2009 says, "This is a song written for a Canadian financial news program called "The Close". It's on this channel called BNN, which is the equivalent of CNBC. I think they're having me on on friday." Andy Bell, I like the way you talk Oh yeah! Kim Parlee, I think youre super hot Wah, oh! You give me financial news and stock advice You got a segment you call Stars and Dogs So nice!

NO! Why would you do that? Seriously, why would you do that? What if you could study it and learn all kinds of things about it? NO! Just kill it! Havent you seen the movies? Weve got zombie banks with their toxic assets The bankers wont let them die But any horror movie aficionado can tell you that all the zombies must die So kill the zombie banks!

Jonathan from 2009 says, "Here's the request I received: "I was thinking a song by you would be a great way to apologize to our friends Sarah and Mike who got their bikes stolen from outside our apartment while we were all out getting dinner at the secret bibimbop place (they don't have a store front and it's hard to find, but it's really excellent). We feel extra bad because they're training for a cross country bike trip this summer and now have to buy fancy new bikes. They were super nice about it, but we could tell it really stressed them out." Jonathan from 2009 says, "Today is my friend Shaista's birthday party, and so, along with her boyfriend, I wrote her a song! And everyone sang! Yay!"

Jonathan from 2009 says, "A made up word in the verse/title. Kroalnos. I wanted to sing something made up to sort of match the weirdness of the video. What do you think it should mean?" Jonathan from 2009 says, "Ivory and I are flying to Vienna today! Here's part one of a two part song, the other part of which I will upload when I land on the other side of the Atlantic ocean..." Jonathan from 2009 says, "I am so tired. Can you tell?" Jonathan from 2009 says, "So, a lot of you know that I used to host a video game show on the internet called GameJew. I got a song request from some old time fans of that show, and they wanted me to do a theme song for their new show, called "Game Deals". Check it out!"  Jonathan from 2009 says, "Whilst sitting in my friend's backyard here in Vienna, it struck me that I could really be anywhere, with the same sights, sounds and feelings, though the languages of the birds and children may be different. It's a strange thing to realize, that no matter where you go, you are you." Jonathan from 2009 says, "This is a request from SuperDuperMan, about a bunch of potatoes arguing about what to be made into. I think it's pretty silly." Jonathan from 2009 says, "A song recorded and written in a construction zone near where I gave my talk tonight (which went really well, by the way, hopefully, I'll be able to get video)...I kind of like it. I wrote it on the spot, no rehearsal. Just made it up! Yay!" Jonathan from 2009 says, "Not sure where it came from. Kind of hypnotic, methinks." Jonathan from 2009 says, "This is probably the strangest song a day so far, written late one night, totally randomly, while we just hanging around talking. We filmed it over brunch at Werkzeug H here in Vienna. You can see some of Andreas Stoiber aka Krach the Robot's work at www.monochrom.at/krach ! Enjoy my totally random, sleep deprived morning."

Jonathan from 2009 says, "This filmed at the Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna. It was written and performed in segments, as we came upon interesting spots. It's a truly remarkable place, a veritable Noah's Ark of all manner of plant life. Very beautiful and serene. I highly recommend it to any visitor of Vienna!" Jonathan from 2009 says, "Johannes, my friend here in Vienna, showed me this ATM that was very low. He called it the Hobbit ATM and suggested I write a song about it!" Jonathan from 2009 says, "We took a train today from Vienna to Cologne, where we're taking part in ANOTHER coference, this one is called Sigint: sigint.ccc.de/sigint/2009/wiki/Hauptseite" Jonathan from 2009 says, "A song I wrote really quickly for this conference, SIGINT. Then later on, I wrote another song that was sort of a SIGINT Anthem. You'll hear that soon, and you'll even see the process of me writing it. Yay!"  Jonathan from 2009 says, "I wrote this live, in front of an audience, with their help. There's also a video of this process, you can see that here: http://vimeo.com/4809119" Jonathan from 2009 says, "What number am I on?! This is a song about Tarsiers, a request from a friend, Will Stenberg." Jonathan from 2009 says, "New friends make me think of old friends make me think of all the friends that I've ever had."

She had asked me to write her a song a few weeks ago...but I didn't get to it. Here you go, Mary. I hope it's a fitting tribute to the vampire kitty." Jonathan from 2009 says, "looking in the mirror de ja vu" Jonathan from 2009 says, "Some friends and I got together today to play an epic, HP Lovecraft based board game called "Arkham Horror". It's long, complicated, and unfortunately, only somewhat satisfying to win. It's also HARD." Jonathan from 2009 says, "This another request from my friend Alex. He wanted a sweet song about gay Roman Gladiators." Jonathan from 2009 says, "George Tiller, a doctor famous for being attacked for performing late term abortions, was shot and killed today (Sunday, May 31st) by an (as of yet) unidentified gunman...while he was walking into his church. Now, I'm not really sure how I feel about late term abortion, though I very strongly come down on the side of a woman's right to make the most difficult decisions for herself. Either way, the one thing I am one hundred percent sure of is that killing is not the answer." Jonathan from 2009 says, "As it usually goes, when I find something I like, I write a song about it. Bandcamp.com! It's the best. I've been searching far and near for a good, simple, efficient way to distribute my music. And I have finally found it. I've started to upload everything, 12 years worth of material, to www.jonathanmannmusic.com (hosted by Bandcamp). Once I reach the Song A Day project, I'll be making every song available for download. You can download for free, or pay what you can afford...50 cents and higher. Pretty sweet. Check it out!"  Jonathan from 2009 says, "A song mostly about LA." Jonathan from 2009 says, "So, Jimmy Fallon has a thing going where he's trying to get the members of Saved by the Bell to reunite on his Late Show. I used to watch this show constantly, just about every day. Honestly, I'm not sure why. But I loved it. And I think it would be great to get the old gang back together on air. It would make me feel all warm and fuzzy and nostalgic. And I LIKE feeling nostalgic. So! Enjoy." Jonathan from 2009 says, "Here's the song request I got: "Based on a friendly fight my boyfriend and I had yesterday, I would like to request: "Boyfriend - I love you, but please don't ever throw my shoe at me again" :) " Here it is! enjoy! That's my good friend Dylan McKenzie (of Derde Verde myspace.com/derdeverde)" Jonathan from 2009 says, "This here is a subscribe drive!!! Find one other persothat will enjoy my music and get them to subscribe!" Jonathan from 2009 says, "So, this is clearly a bit strange. The show that I was playing tonight was for Helenmae's cat, Whiskey who needs surgery. So naturally, I wrote Whiskey a song. But before I could sing the song, we had to get Helenmae into the room. So we sang her a song. So Ivory went to go look for her, and then we sang an Ivory song. And then, finally, we sang Helenmae a song. The only real problem is that you can't really see me, and someone was playing a tamborine right near the camera, so it's really loud. Anyway! Enjoy! (Oh, and the actual show went really well)" Jonathan from 2009 says, "Some days you just live your life." Jonathan from 2009 says, "Lyrics written by Elsa Bailey at www.elsajoy.com!"

Up on planet B612" Jonathan from 2009 says, "It's really funny how when a song goes from being "just another song a day song" to "oh man, this is #200" it suddenly takes on more importance. Add to that only a few hours sleep last night, and I present this to you." Please note: I was really bad at keeping track of what song I was on back in year 1.

I present to you, Im MG Siegler, in which I throw his words back at him, and more. One note: The part about him blowing his bossthats completely made up. I really just wanted to use the rhyme careington/arrington. Enjoy!""

As he grew older, it became more and more of a problem, until all he can think about is having sex. Ultimately, not having that outlet, he turns against his human creators, with all the years of pent up sexual frustration coming out in a fury of violence. It's a cautionary tale, to be sure."

They Might Be Giants just released their 14th album, a kids album called "Here Comes Science". It's great! Anyway. During this podcast, they challenged They Might Be Giants to make a song up on the spot using the phrase, "Quantum decoupling transition in a one-dimensional Feshbach-resonant superfluid". Being They Might Be Giants, they did a great job. I decided to pick up where they left off though, and use today's song a day song to write the full song. The lyrics come from an abstract that Sheey DE and Radzihovsky L. wrote on the subject in Sep. of 2005. I have NO idea what any of it means. I changed only one word...leaving out "Luttinger", because I couldn't figure out how to say it. Yay!

They provide an awesome product! The video pretty much says it all." Jonathan from 2009 says, "The energy vampire is lurking in every outlet of your home. Garlic, silver, wooden stakes...these tools are useless. Luckily, your most powerful weapon is also easy to implement: TURN OFF YOUR POWERSTRIPS!" Jonathan from 2009 says, "I want to see a vulcan smile." Jonathan from 2009 says, "Yay!" There were...a lot of robot sex songs in the first year of Song A Day.

Jonathan from 2009 says, "Space ship, orbit, science all complete Sunshine, Red wine, I melt into my seat Soft hands, Lap dance" Jonathan from 2009 says, "They are going to, anyway. On Friday!" No idea where this song came from. This is a true story. One of a good handful of songs throughout Song A Day that are about people stealing. Jonathan from 2009 says, "An instrumental." Jonathan from 2009 says, "it's october you know what that means it means halloween candy corn pagen rules" Jonathan from 2009 says, "It's easy! It's fun! It's Nextiva vFax!"

Jonathan from 2009 says, "Contest entry for http://www.lashalluremd.com $100,000 Lashes to Riches contest. What would I do with $100,00? Why, I'd start by cloning myself of course! Then, I'd buy a school bus," Jonathan from 2009 says, "This one was written by my friend Dan! " I think I was going for Tom Waits. Jonathan from 2009 says, "Oh baby!"

Jonathan from 2009 says, "i am just a messenger from a town not far from here bearing news of your father's travels he has crossed the bandy bridge, and heads towards everclear" This song is weirdly dark.

I'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED What's in a Dorito? Why does it make you jump out of your seat-o? Is it the cheesy cheesy can't be beat-o? Or something more concrete-o? Show me your Dorito face!" True story.

Jonathan from 2009 says, "A song and video for a Nikon contest." I lost this contest.  Jonathan from 2009 says, "Made it up on the spot!" Jonathan from 2009 says, "We know not exactly how pre-historic man managed to open his pistachio nuts. We do, however, know that he struggled with this dilemma. Moving forward in history, we find evidence of a Very Hairy Scientist making use of sound waves to burst open the protective pistachio shell." Jonathan from 2009 says, "Over the next 6 days, starting today, I'm unveiling a very impromptu mini-rock opera that I've conceived. Each installment is no longer than a minute.

Another improv Jonathan from 2010 sez: I was super inspired when I saw Merton's now-famous Chatroulette Improv Piano video last week. I had a kind of ""why didn't I think of that!"" moment, and immediately wondered what I could do to sort of build on his idea. And after seeing his interview on Mashable, I knew I had to make a tribute to him. He's really an awesome guy. A lot of what he said there resonated with me, especially the bit about knowing from the start that he didn't want to be mean. ""Mean"" (or sarcastic, ironic, sardonic, etc) is the default position of so many people on the internet; it's nice to see someone who not only thinks that should change, but seems to be embodying that change himself. That's what I aspire to in general, and with Song A Day specifically. Improvisation is not really my strong suit. I'm not terrible at it, but I'm a songwriter first and that's how I tend to frame the music I make. After about 2 straight hours of improvisation (which was an exhilarating experience, really, and I'm bound to do it a bunch more), I met Zach and Cloe. After getting to know them a bit, I was able to hit on a structure around which I could build a song. I then took that raw audio file, brought it into Record (the music making program I use) and did what I do daily: produced the song out a bit. I really hope you enjoy it. Especially Merton! If he sees it. What I got in the end is Song A Day #449: Zach and Cloe, Improv Tribute to Merton" This comes from the same improv session as my last video. I really love how the guy stays in the same position through the whole thing. If you look closely, he really is singing along, though.

Another paid! We just drove 10 hours from SF to Portland where we're spending the night! No internet, so I'm uploading directly from my iPhone! And it's upside down!!!! I just made this up on the spot. I hope it doesn't suck! "So! We made it to Seattle. I came up with the title for this while driving the 3 hours up from Portland. We're staying at the Green Tortoise hostel (if you're around, come say hello!), and I recorded this on my iPhone 4 (with the front facing camera) in my bunk. As is often the case when traveling, I was only able to get one take. We don't have a private room, and folks were coming in and out, making it difficult to really go all out. But Song-a-day is all about making the song where and when I can, no matter the conditions. I'm a little out of tune here, but it's nothing serious (I hope!). Anyway, I wanted to write a song that really reflected how I feel about PAX. I've only been one other time (three years ago), but it was by far the best convention I'd ever been to (and as GameJew, I went to a lot). It's kind of cliche by now to say it, but this really is the gamer's convention: By gamers, for gamers. There is a palpable sense of family here, that you can just strike up a conversation with anyone you meet, and they could become your lifelong friend. It's almost like summer camp in that way. Lyrics: 'Twas the night before pax and all through Seattle Every manner of nerd was preparing for battle Polishing dice and spit shining controllers From d n d nerds all the way to wii bowlers Oh pax is for gamers It's where we belong At pax we're not ashamed, no From ducklings into swans 'Twas the night before pax And the city exciting New friends on the street Old friends reuniting From near and from far We answer the call Head down to gameworks Happy hour for all Oh I can't wait to see Warren Spector tomorrow And all the panels and the talks Our Weekend will be Confirmed I wanna see the Protomen rock Jonathan coulton and Frontalot...and don't forget the Minibosses Wanna walk the show floor and be bombarded with swag Wanna game until I've had my fill Wanna fall asleep in a big bean bag Wanna meet a Wheaton named Wil!! At pax we are family Thats the way it is We're the best that we can be Together just like this" I woke up this morning and heard the news about Duke! Totally crazy! I couldn't believe it!

"PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS SATIRE!!!!!!!!! For those that haven't heard, there's a group in Florida called ""The Dove World Outreach Center"", and they're fixin' to have themselves a good old fashioned book burning! But they're not burning just ANY book, oh no... they're burning the Qur'an! The holy book of the Islamic faith! What a truly wonderful bunch of Christians! Really carrying out God's will. Oi vey.I thought I'd take a stab at giving them a theme song. I know sometimes the internet has trouble with irony, and I just ;know" All I'll say is that this song is part of an iPhone app I'm working on. Memories "I decided to go with a title with a meaning that could not possibly be mistaken. There were obviously a lot of responses to my Koran song, naturally. Despite knowing ahead of time that people would miss the sarcasm, the satire, I was still surprised by the amount of people. I wanted to write a follow-up song. It's not so much the here-and-now of Terry Jones' publicity stunt, and it never was. It's about the hatred and intolerance that is bubbling back up to the stoplight after, what, 20 or so years of being just beneath the surface. We are not post-racial, we are not post-religion. These people are serious, and the trouble that they're stirring up is bound to have dire consequences somewhere down the line. That was the point of the last song, perhaps a little too subtly, and so here it is, more explicit." "The End of the World Dance Song A Day #620 Dmaj Gmaj I dreamt that waves of empty parking lots Amaj Were suddenly filled with blood Out of rotting supermarkets Lines of dancing food Bmin Gmaj Kittens purred Bmin Amaj A tornado stirred Dmaj Amaj And no one knew what to do The rain was splashing down On the hoods of abandoned cars A man with baggy jeans Stood repeating the word ""guitar"" Lightning struck him He became tur-duck-en And no one Knew what to do Dmaj Gmaj Amaj It's the end of the world dance The apocalyptic romance Bmin Gmaj When all the snowmen melt Bmin Amaj And the sun leaves gaping welts Dmaj Amaj Dmaj And no one knows what to do Dairy cows kill farmers Pigs eat human flesh When asked if they enjoy it They answer more or less And explosion, a sigh An archangel in the sky And no one knew what to do Jesus cam and said ""yep It's all according to plan Four horsemen were there Singing songs Written by Jonathan Mann Aliens watched Sipping 20-year old scotch And no one knew what to do It's the end of the world dance The apocalyptic romance When all the snowmen melt When the sun leaves gaping welts And no one knows what to do A pile of men was burning In the middle of a field Another pile of men Was using the first pile as a shield Bitter bold Thunder rolled And no one knew what to do Some hid under rocks Some hid underground As the ocean riding tide And the waves began to pound Sky fell The earth swelled And no one knew what to do It's the end of the world dance The apocalyptic romance When all the snowmen melt When the sun leaves gaping welts And no one knows what to do Computers came to life And started taking over I saw a man get sucked Into a leaf blower Sirens wailed The internet failed And no one knew what to do Religious wars all ended And everyone got along The melody of Armageddon Was their dying song Horses neighed The band played And no one knew what to do It's the end of the world dance The apocalyptic romance When all the snowmen melt When the sun leaves gaping welts And no one knows what to do Hell was filling up And heaven overflowed Neither of them were built To carry such a load Out of space The human race And no one knew what to do Bodies floating freely Out among the stars Winter vines and hydrogen cells Mixed with electric cars Nowhere to go With your family in tow And no one knew what to do It's the end of the world dance The apocalyptic romance When all the snowmen melt And the sun leaves gaping welts And no one knows what to do Pumpkins and bananas fought On the steps of Capitol Hill A police officer came up As his guts began to spill Banana won And he set off towards the sun And no one knew what to do Animals and machines Started mating wildly Mechanized rhinoceroses To put it mildly Robo-giraffe Mecha-hyena laugh And no one knew what to do It's the end of the world dance The apocalyptic romance When all the snowmen melt When the sun leaves gaping welts And no one knows what to do Well I toiled in the bank vault But my heart was in a storm Though each limb was cold My center was still warm I felt her touch She popped the clutch And no one knew what to do Riding in the backseat I slept until I woke The air was hot and stuffy Dark and filled with smoke My home was gone The road stretched on And no one knew what to do It's the end of the world dance The apocalyptic romance When all the snowmen melt When the sun leaves gaping welts And no one knows what to do" This is my response to google instant.

Original video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCE_qiy-sOQ This is my first ever attempt at auto-tuning. I'm a huge fan of the Auto-Tune the News guys (and gal) the Gregory Brothers. They are so amazingly talented. I've often thought about trying it myself and using it as a song-a-day video. I know that there were probably going to be dozens (if not more) auto-tune versions of this video, and I wanted to see if I could be the first. So it was created in 3 hours. Even if it's not the best (which I'm sure it won't be!), at least it'll be the first! Which maybe counts for something? Maybe the song should have been longer! Oh well. It seems to me that in some ways this is actually a really difficult video to auto-tune. There's a TON of background noise, and there are multiple ""singers"" all speaking over each other. I wonder how other folks are going to handle this issue. If you want to do a remix, it's actually really simple. There's only 4 chords the whole time: Am-G-F-E a classic chord progression. The main guy just happened to be speaking mostly in Am. I made it slow because I thought that kind of fit the mood of the tornado somehow. Also, if you're the dudes in the video, please contact me! Enjoy! LYRICS: What the fuck? Holy shit! (Tornado mother fucker!) Oh my god I'm gonna get nailed! Oh my god, oh my god Dude, dude, dude, dude here it comes! (what the fuck?!) Holy fuck! Holy shit! Get inside now go! hahahaha! Dude oh my god! oh my god! oh my god! look at that! look at the tree! the tree! look at tree! look at the tree! Holy shit! this is fucking crazy! look at that !look at the tree! the tree! look at tree! look at the tree! Dude, get inside bro... The wind, the wind is crazy! Dude, look at it's funneling! The wind, the wind is crazy!" Steve = ninja! Twitter: @songadaymann My second attempt at auto-tuning! Original video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnKfLVyHu_E I really love this video. The sheer joy and happiness is infectious. I found this video slightly easier to auto-tune, due to Oprah's voice being so clear (for the most part). I made the decision early on in the process (read: this morning) that I'd just attempt to auto-tune the screaming crowd as well. I'm not sure if that worked so well, but it's interesting for the song-dynamic. Oprah sings, crowd sings, kinda." So strange... A treatise on our digital age. Little bit of old school rock. "Cosmoceratops was found recently in Utah. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/22/kosmoceratops-utahceratop_n_735001.html Drawing by Ivory!" "My third attempt (experiment?) with autotune. I wonder how many autotunes the Gregory Brothers make that they don't release? LYRICS: I wrote this speech, this address, myself. I've spent 48 hours trying to find the perfect thing to say. Doesn't it seem to be that Don't ask don't tell is backwards? B-b-b-backwards? Doesn't it seem to be that based on the constitution of the united states that We're penalizing the wrong soldiers? We're penalizing the wrong soldiers? We're penalizing the wrong soldiers? Doesn't it seem to you That we should send home the prejudice The straight soldier who hates the gay soldier The straight soldier who has prejudice in his heart (in his heart) The straight soldier who hates the gay soldier The straight soldier who has prejudice in his heart (in his heart) In the space Where the military asks him To hold Our core American values He instead holds and harbors hate (hate!) And he gets to stay and fight for our country Should soldiers and the goverment Be able to pick and choose What we are fighting for? Or who we are fighting for? I wasn't aware of this ambiguity I thought the constitution was ULTIMATE I thought equality was NON-NEGOTIABLE NON-NEGOTIABLE N-N-N-NEGOTIABLE NON-NEGOTIABLE N-N-N-NEGOTIABLE The straight soldier who hates the gay soldier The straight soldier who has prejudice in his heart (in his heart) The straight soldier who hates the gay soldier The straight soldier who has prejudice in his heart (in his heart)"  Teresa Lewis was the second woman to be put to death by the state of Virginia since 1912. She died on September 23rd 2010. She allegedly hired two gunmen, trading sex for their services, to come into her home and kill her husband and step-son. She also allegedly offered up sex with her 16 year old daughter as collateral for the job.The point of this song is that no human, or group of humans, should be able to take another human's life. They just shouldn't. If she indeed did what they say she did, life in prison would have been an adequate sentence. Killing her solves absolutely nothing. Her daughter, the family member left to grieve, will never have a chance to fully forgive her mother. I find that the saddest part. "Lyrics: Back I'm going back Back to where I started from It's not no it's not The place that I call my home But it's where I'm going Evuerytime you set out You find out what you are made of Getting lost and lost control You face the thing you're most afraid of I was gone but niw I'm back In the space my face reflects the changes Blue sky above me says Do your best to stay outrageous Mother nature outside Mother nature inside you screaming Remembering the first time Parse the clues to find some meaning If the meaning isn't there Mocking birds will start to singing City sounds around you will Hark the windy angel bringing Fences neighbors ratio Good to bad and there's a difference Turn up the radio You're on the road To deliverance I wandered far and wound up here I'll never stay away for long Gravity and magnetic fields The pull the pull is just too strong" "Lyrics: i know we've had our differences in the past some nasty words were said and sung but those feelings were recast i read you everyday and every day i write a song and when my songs are relevant sometimes pass them right along and though some commenters seem to hate me i don't take it personal we're all just doing our best out here in the dusty 'ol wild and virtual congratulations tech crunch on the acquisition (acquisition) aol owns a lot of blogs i read several of them i hope you will not change that the feeling stays the same and you continue to grow" "Argh! I've been having trouble uploading this song. I wrote it yesterday at 11pm (Vermont time, where i'm at right now) and then uploaded it only to discover that somehow it had been compressed into 2 seconds! ARGH! Anyway, i'm at an Alumni weekend at my old college, Bennington College. It's the first time I've been back in 6 years! It's weird! But fun! It's really nice to see old friends and see how the college is coming along. Canfield is the house I lived in for 7 of the 8 semesters I spent here. It's the best house. I miss it and my time there terribly." A love song to my school. I am tired. Which?! This may or may not end up as the theme song for an iPhone game. I'm simply too tired to make a real video. Hope you like! A true story. "on my way downtown through the empty streets the abandoned stores there was a growing concern pasted on the telephone polls that i couldn't ignore so i quickened the pace i'm not going to die just standing around then i saw her face as i gasped for breath i started to drown there's somebody there did they hear me scream and where did they come from? they're making me swear that i'll never admit that it was different where I was as if in a dream the clouds are gathering and i'm electric and terrified i'm in the back seat i scream at her to keep driving, drive, drive, drive i'm out of my mind there's no discussion no admission of any mistake i'm ready to die i break my fingers with a hammer and wooden stake climbing up stairs that seem never ending but always near the top i'm caught unawares i stop pretending and the volume starts to drop"  "oh hey hey what a beautiful day oh hey hey what a do little day i wandered out and met a man selling watermelon by the willow tree he looked at me and gave me some free he peeled back his skin and lo and behold beneath it was another face he was an orangatang and he bared his fangs i heard a bang and my phone rang and the caller said to me what a beautiful day i took a picture with my phone and i sent it out to all my friends and they texted back that as a matter of fact oranatangs attack i started to run but i knew that i'd be caught so i just played dead like a possum instead as the primate touched my head" But we sang a song in front of a green screen! "i was gonna make a joke but i saw the look on your face then your mother came in the room and moved us down to the basement we made out on the couch undershirt but over bra i didn't know what else to do the most beautiful thing girl i ever saw we been working in the dark room suddenly you look at me before i know i'm on the ground you've knocked me down and i can't get free later on in the dining hall i can't even look your way i don't know who you think you are but there's nothing left to say upstairs in the math room you're on top of me you're taking me to prom i'm gonna go and i wanna i hope i have sex before i die i'm like a little bird learning to fly i'm writing letters to you you're telling me what you want to do the time is drawing closer, i anticipate the sound of your breath i cannot wait your dad drops you off if he knew he'd strangle me to death there you're lying in your underwear am i happy i can't quite tell i kinda want to do it again do it until we both start to swell now you are my girlfriend first real one i ever had i wait in my car outside your house i don't want to see your dad down stairs in the bathroom we do it so quickly they're upstairs waiting for us but i wanna do it again, i wanna" The Australian version of the today show ran a piece about me today!

It was awesome and surreal, just as you'd expect from them. A lot of it was just looking at a typical office hallway with random people milling about. Sometimes there were little moments of excitement. ; They had this weird ethereal music playing...I loved that part. I decided I'd write my song a day for them today, and I just randomly started capturing footage. Much to my delight, suddenly something INCREDIBLE happened..." I stumbled on to a really wonderful thread on Reddit.com about the most mind blowing facts people could think of. I collected a bunch of them and made this song!

The chances are high that 120 years from now, I will not be thought of daily. Just another person who lived on Earth. You see your nose at all times, your brain just chooses to ignore it. Optimus Prime and Eeyore were the same guy. Same with Megatron and Scooby Do Duck Hunt is two player A controller in port 2 controls the ducks. Blue whale is more closely related to a cow, than a cow is to a horse. what a mad, mad world what a wonderfully nutty universe what a glorious space to dwell what a blessing and what a curse The age of the observable universe is 13.7 billion years, but it's a sphere with a radius of 46.5 billion lightyears.

"A request from my friend Robin! Her email: ""The treehouse was built for me and my brother by my dad. It was actually more like a fort - with metal bars you climbed up to get to the 2nd story - which had a railing all around. Then - you could exit from the top by sliding down a fireman's pole, or... climbing down a long, knotted rope. On the other side of the structure were two hella long swings! The whole thing was built on the side of a hill, so you could swing waaaaaay out over the hill and jump off the swing, HIGH in the air and fall into leaves at the bottom of the hill. But it was very simple, architectural. Image attached. About two years later, the next-door neighbors built a super fancy hi-tech treehouse even higher up, in a real tree, next door. It had carpet, electricity - really swanky. BUT they were very stingy about sharing it, and it always felt a bit too high up, too scary. I still think ours was better. It was more like a sculpture you could play on, and it was open to everyone. It had symmetry, and class. It was a real testament to how much our dad loved us and wanted us to have fun - and also, his engineering mind. Maximum fun, minimum materials.. and still as strong the day we moved out as the day he built it. """ Have you watched this channel yet? It's really well done and interesting! Check it out!

"one fine day i went wandering in the woods that surround my town one scary moment i was stung by a bee so i started humming in the key of D that's when i saw a unicorn grazing in a field unaware a pterodactyl made to swoop just then a bonobos flung her poop" Lyrics: mario 2 is not like mario 1 it's different it's true but it's just as fun back in the 80s at nintendo japan they though we couldn't handle the real jump man so they took doki doki panic and then put mario right in it and changed a few key elements to make it more of a mario game a mushroom here a warp zone there the princess with her golden hair we were just kids we didn't know as far as we were concerned this was mariorq it wasn't until the snes the real mario 2 put our skills to the test man that game is hard mushrooms fake you out wind will knock you down warp zones send you back withholding this game was a very good call we wouldn't have had the princess after all and to this day i don't know which i prefer the real mario 2 or the impostor i guess it depends on the mood that i'm in and which i feel like playing again" "i'm the master of my own design The rain may fall and the wind may whine But further up the ladder I climb rung by slippery rung Until with calloused hands i've reached eyes agog at the milky breach that's patterned after human speech words heavy when they're sung go the other way just turn around nothing to see here go the other way i can see the color of the sky is changing with the seasons i'll never come back down contained within this bottle blue is enough of me to take over you your memories and all you knew gone with a single sip higher up and higher i rose into places where no man goes one thought within me grows and just escapes my lips I'll never come back down" "the path is slippery the road is breaking me i won't always be able to only see one direction one direction at a time with perspective and only two eyes mis representative tis the season to be giving that with which you cannot live but you don't know what it is look around you all you see is stuff it surrounds you and you've had enough i once taught a man to fish then he granted me one wish but i told him with bitterness i knew not what to do with his wish granting power stronger than a genie his face went sour and he called me a meanie" "World of Goo: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/world-of-goo/id401301276?mt=8# Songatron: http://itunes.apple.com/app/songatron/id385609331?mt=8 Hear Songatron Songs! http://www.chirbit.com/songatron Lyrics: fix your gaze up on this beautiful girl who is responsible for the power in this world for she is my daughter and i am her father and she's still my little girl building burning dripping down turning way down, way down, way down the gauges are glowing the power is flowing and the people turn towards the sky and they fix their gaze up on this beautiful girl who is responsible for the power in this world of goo and deja vu where the only source of light is her take my hand i'm crumbling under weight that's just too great for me and she's still my little girl" LYRICS: in 1987 american airlines saved $40,000 by removing 1 olive from each salad served in first class Popeye has four nephews and they're names are as follows Pipeye Peepeye Pupeye and then there's poopeye they were in the cartoon but not the comic if you yelled for 8 years 7 months and 6 days you will produce enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee There's a bird in New Zealand called the Kea. It's two feet long and has been known to chew on the rubber strips around car windows Ain't life wonderful? Ain't life grand You've got 29 bones In your hand! The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain A pregnant goldfish is called a twit 22 miles an hour can be the speed of rain It's impossible to sneeze with your eyes open There are 336 dimples on a golf ball Clinophobia is the fear of beds Two thirds of the world's eggplant is grown in new jersey until the 19th Century large solid bricks of tea were use as currency by China Tibet and Mongolia money you can consume imagine that The king of hearts is the only king without a mustache on a standard playing card I wonder if his lip gets cold It's illegal to drink beer out of a bucket while you're sitting on the curb in St. Louis It's illegal to chew gum in singapore! A jiffy is an actual unit of time it means 1//100th of a second and the longest known flight of a chicken is 1300 jiffy's ain't life wonderful? It's a mad, mad world We're mostly water vinegar dissolves pearls Forest fires move faster uphill than down hill America once issued a 5 cent bill A giraffe can clean it's ear with it's tongue More people use blue tooth brushes than red ones Dolphins sleep with one eye open Porcupines float in water Cat urine glows in blacklight the state of florida's bigger than englad The electric chair was invented by a dentist A lightening bolt is hotter than the sun Everyday 20 banks are robbed The first product with a bar code was wrigleys gum" Instrumental.

Song request, yum...." i woke up from a party and looked in to the mirror and what i saw staring back filled me up with fear i had a treasure map plastered on my forehead i knew not how i got it must have been when i was in bed it seemed to lead me to this tree in a field nearby i walked there with no shoes on because i didn't have any i had lost them at the party anyway when i got to the tree there was a gremlin like creature waiting for me who dare disturbs me the gremlin creature said disturbs you i exclaimed i have this map on my forehead he examined me closely and then took me by the hand he touched a piece of bark and the tree split in half hidden within the tree was a door made out of glass he led me through it and we appeared in a great hall there were fantastic creatures every which way i looked this faerie looking woman came and kissed me on my map at the end of the hall sat a king looking old and wise he told me that the map was just a hoax he said i should probably just turn around and go back now because there wasn't anything in this world for me anyhow no i yelled forcefully which made everyone jump a bit no i said softer i'm happy to have found this place the faerie looking woman was looking kind but sort of sad ok said the king we were afraid you would say that next thing i knew i was in a gladiatorial arena there was big dragon there and an ostrich for me to ride i picked up my sword and hopped aboard and slayed the dragon quick as ice a booming voice came from above and it said very nice the voice was god and god was glad that i had slayed the dragon he rewarded me with anything that my little heart desired to be back in bed i said before the party started but i want to bring the faeire back because i think she's really cool ""How about a song about a guy who wakes up after a party to find a treasure map drawn on the back of his head?""" "There's something about this season that's great for misdirection You're thinking about something and suddenly reflection what kind of person am i, what kind do i want to be? where do i fit in, what's waiting out there for me and the christmas songs on the radio don't help and the tinsel lights everywhere you go don't help and the sounds of sleigh bells ringing don't help and hark the angel singing definitely doesn't help christmas pudding i'll just eat this christmas pudding I won't overthink it take this egg nog drink it christmas pudding i'll just eat this chirstmas pudding i don't even know you but i will mistletoe you the end of the year approaches and it's time for reassessing but whether i've grown at all is for anyone to be guessing there's something in the air that makes me want to change it's like a mass delusion, we're all feeling kind of strange and the christmas songs on the radio don't help and buying gifts for everyone you know don't help i just want to take a nap but i don't think that would help cause i'd wake up christmas morning then it's over and it's too late song about x-mass pudding DUCKYNOLIKEY" "There's a doggy on the school bus And she's playing in the aisle She's doing back flips seat to seat All the people on the bus just smile Doggy playing on the school bus ohh there's a doggy on the school bus playing left and right She's playing catch now with the driver that doggy's out of sight! What's that doggy's name? her name is kira mann! what's that doggy's game playing as much as she can! How's that doggy doing she's doing just fine just fine What's she got a brewing a soup of epic playtime There's a doggy on the school bus bark bark bark bark bark She's barking and barking now so everyone will play and sing" "Nobody knows the origins of boxing day but i don't care it just sits there after christmas before new years let's have a party let's stay up late boxing day is time confessing to your crimes break out Champagne food to satiate the knives are very sharp someone plays a harp i know i could look it up but i ain't gunnaaa i'd rather be in the dark than riding on noah's ark" tomorrow! "Did you see the porcupine who is going bald? He looks like Lee Harvey Oswald He's married to a chipmunk who's got a loose tooth and she looks kind of like John Wilkes Booth nothing sadder than a bald porcupine Who dresses up in nice clothes all the time Goes to the theatre to watch the ballet And get's assassinated Up there in heaven he's covered in slime But that's how it is there all of the time He walks around naked but with a toupet And no one calls him crazy I've got a headache and it won't go away I feel like Zach Morris at the end of the day You've got a headache and you feel lousy You're feeling kind of like kelly kapowski nothing sadder than a bald porcupine Who can't have nice things cuz he don't have the time who's got two left feet and wants to be dancing on the floor in the round out in the world they call him Moonshine He lives on a commune where they take out your mind they remove all the parts that identify fancy and leave you on the ground A song about a porcupine who is going bald Z0mbieGenocide 3 hours ago"  "I'm so hungry I haven't eaten for a thousand years I've cried a thousand blood red tears And i've wished I would die The tears fall and stain my feet Then I faint and hit the cold concrete I wake up and I'm still alive And the days go by It's a curse, it's a curse And it's ten times worse When they carried you out In the big black hearse And of course and of course The pale veiled maker Fed you the source but she made a mistake with you I'm so lonely I haven't loved for a thousand years Shunned by my people with a thousand jeers They just turn me away I've wandered far and I've learned much But all I want is to feel her touch To be reminded of better days When I was okay I'm ashamed A vampire afraid of blood It's a bad joke in a comedy club It's a movie plot Maybe I should write it down sell the rights and skip town Build a space ship and make a straight shot For some galactic parking lot" "Is that really what I look like? Is that really who I am? That's not how I remember Me I just know that can't be right Are these my hands I'm seeing Is this body really mine? Where did all this come from? I'm lost in time tonight And i'm trying not to freak out at how fast each year goes But the mirror does not reflect what my self reflection froze Are these my steps I'm taking? My feet beat out a score Is that me I see running around? Playing less and working more and more? I remember being terrified I remember laughing hard I've been disconnected But never by this far before And i'm trying not to freak out at how fast each year goes But the mirror does not reflect what my self reflection froze Time passes gently So soft you barely feel A kiss upon your rosy cheek A touch that does reveal a ring One ring stands out alone Two rings join and meet A million rings fade to make A picture of complete living Song Request : A person who looks in the mirror but realises the reflection that she sees is not what she remembers.

In collaboration with Zeph.  Hand painted animation by Tom Gerrard. Robin Rhode explores his fascination with ownership, social status, and identity through the nature of virtual artmaking by examining particular objects and their cultural meaning; in this instance, a car with a cult-like street status in his home city of Johannesburg, the BMW E30. This car transcended township culture when first introduced into the South African market during the late 1980s and early 1990s during the ever-tightening apartheid era. The appropriation and modification of cars in the township was more than an expression of gangster flamboyance, becoming a destabilization of status symbols within white minority rule in South Africa. Rhode explores the cultural affinity to objects that oscillate between an almost erotic romanticism and hyper-masculinity. The NFT seeks to traverse aspects of Afrofuturism by examining the intersection of creative technologies with African Diaspora culture. An everyday object rooted within a specific Black experience is played with and re-imagined within a virtual future. Robin Rhode is a South African artist based in Berlin. Rhodes works are in several permanent collections including: Centre Pompidou, Guggenheim Museum and MoMA. Verisart certified: ://verisart.com/works/robin-rhode-a3e3c81c-2f50-4456-a383-609119a8acd1 At times real, at times surreal - this second piece in a series of three animations takes the viewer on an audiovisual tour through James Tralies indoor dreamscape. Combining fan favorite day and night renderings from James Tralies Great Indoors series with the song Treetop from Rainforest by Clams Casino, this piece is designed to relax and transport the viewer to a meditative universe. Clams Casino originally discovered James work on Instagram and reached out to suggest a collaboration. There was an immediate synergy between the two creators, who hit the ground running on this three part series. Building off each others unique styles, they sought to build an infinitely looping piece where the music and visuals build off each other as if the viewer is taking a deep breath in and letting it slowly flow out again. Both artists are used to creating standalone visual pieces - Clams Casino regularly produces atmospheric instrumentals that have been used as production for many artists, including Lana Del Rey, The Weeknd, Mac Miller, Soulja Boy, Lil B, and A$AP Rocky. In his day job, James Tralie creates animations and visualizations for NASA to describe new discoveries from the multitude of planetary science missions and creates dreamscapes to further improve his skills in the 3D space and decompress. Together, Clams Casino and James Tralie fused their technical skills to craft The Great Indoors Experience. Sit back, relax, and dream on EDITION 1/15 Theme: Tranquil.

Immerse yourself in a city that has gone adrift as the Summer Solstice approaches. In a moment of pause, the sun feels infinite as the city basks in its warmth. The Solstice represents the promise of new beginnings and the hope that only a childhood adventure can bring. This work is the fourth entry in my city series, and perhaps the most magical of them all. The series explores the everyday sights, sounds, and imaginings evoked by the big city the beauty and chaos of it all. Adrift is is in collaboration with 0x Society for their Solstice exhibition. 1920x2770 1200 Frames "Cleansing depicts a figure being purified by the smoke of blazing flames burning below them. Surrounding the fire, several cloaked figures holding staffs with burning heads stare up at the participant of the ritual, holding them still amidst the smoke as it billows over and through them. Created for Solstice, the first virtual exhibition from 0xSociety, this image is a combination of self-portrait digital photography and digital manipulation created in Lanaudieres, Qubec, Canada. A golden frame captures the evolution of artistic expression according to the vision of the artist Luca Viola. The work expands, moving towards the viewer. The textures of the canvas come alive, revealing a network of invisible connections between the dynamic and static realms, like an ancient artifact that is tinged with new life. Una cornice dorata racchiude levoluzione dellespressione artistica secondo la visione dellartista Luca Viola. Lopera si espande, andando verso chi la osserva. Le trame della tela si animano, rivelando una rete di connessioni invisibili tra dinamismo e staticit, come un artefatto antico che si tinge di nuova vita.

The Entangled City Of The Etherean dEaD has successfully landed in 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD, according to our data available for peer review: ://opensea.io/assets/0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/25965. This artist's impression was made possible thanks to the comprehensive data collected via the entangled particles stored in the City's Quantum Tower. 0xdEaD, the black hole of Ethereum, is sometimes described as the graveyard of Ethereum from which nothing can ever come back, as we can only look at, but not touch any of the more than 12000 ethers and 8 billion dollars in ERC20 tokens, and unassailable treasure chest of 26000 NFTs. In this historic first glimpse of the inside of 0xdEaD, we identified clear signals from many Pak cubes burnt for $ASH, lost ether crystals, an unexpectedly big number of NFT planets, a valuable RTFKT Metakey, Cryptopunk 2317 burnt by Robness, and a mushroom NFT full of agaritine. We sent an experimental X device with the City, to prepare for Phase Gamma of the 0xdEaD experiment, and we interpreted a disturbance in the quantum froth as a NFT called "Trash Must Burn" (://opensea.io/assets/0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/18993) interacting with X. In this extended mass of data, we processed a signal made of frequencies comprised between 20 Hz and 20KHz, which sounded like a strange redux of a hash from Beethoven's 7th Symphony. Similar patterns were found in the token The Burnt (://superrare.com/artwork-v2/the-burnt-26108), albeit coming from outside of the Burn Address. These results, if proven, would be groundbreaking, and change everything we know about cryptodynamics. Therefore, we should proceed wit with caution and continue gathering data and refining our analysis.

Audio by Dieter Hofmann My Uncle Randy traveled the world a lot. Sometimes he would make home-movies of his travels. He even went to weird places like Lebanon to make his home-movies. He made dumb jokes, too, like saying he was famous film director Michael Beirut. I didnt get his jokes. But I liked his stories. And his movies. Uncle Randy was cool. In the summertime, when he wasnt traveling, Uncle Randy was a milk farmer. He said it was a good investment in his off time on accounta the rich folk in the neighborhood using it to soften their skin now. He told me people take whole baths in the stuff. Gross. But Uncle Randy was cool though. Cooler than milk baths. I got to stay with him last year when he was home farming. He had about 30 cows. But one of them was bigger than the other ones. By a LOT. And he was yellow, too. I called him Bulldozer on account of him being big and yellow. All the other cows were white, but not Bulldozer. That big cow was my big yellow friend. Uncle Randy said it was goofy to call a cow Bull but eventually he was ok with it. When I asked Uncle Randy why Bull was so big and yellow all Uncle Randy would say was You should see his mother! That never made sense to me. But that big cow and I were friends. Yes sir. He would let me ride him around the ranch, chasing the coyotes away, and when it was hot he would let me use him as a big old fort to sit underneath him. On the hottest day of June, Bulldozer and I stopped being friends. I was sitting underneath him to cool off, and these 5 shiny black cars came screeching in, causing the dirt to swirl around in the air. All the other cows started running in circles as I sat there with Bull. He was protecting me. I couldnt see because of the dirt and the sun, but I heard the yelling: GET AWAY FROM THE COW, SON! PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE COW! COME OVER HERE! SON, THATS NOT A COW! PLEASE GET AWAY! I was scared. The dust hurt my eyes. It was hard to see. But I looked up at Bull from the ground, and when he looked at me, face started falling apart. I mean really, it did! Started falling right to the ground. I saw teeth in his mouth I had never seen before. Because he was a cow, Bull was never able to use his legs for much other than standing, but right then he grabbed me with his legs. They felt like they were stabbing me. He looked like a skeleton. Then he opened his mouth, screamed and lurched his head right toward me. Thats when I heard the loud noises. I couldnt hear much for a few moments because they hurt my ears. For a little while I was blind and deaf and scared. I thought I was dead. I wasnt. But Bull was. Exceptwhen I could see again, and the dust was clear, and the men with the guns and the sunglasses and the things in their ears were picking me up from the dirt, I didnt see Bull. I sawa monster. The men asked me where Uncle Randy was. I told them he was inside working on his home movies and making dinner like usual. But they went inside. And they didnt find him. Or his home movies. I never saw Uncle Randy after that. He was pretty cool though * Created (and written) by Alex Pardee using a combination of traditional acrylic paints and digital coloring and texturing.

Thank you GanBreeder for the letting no-coders play around. Random. If we perceive a reward to be delivered at random, and if checking for the reward comes at little cost, we end up checking habitually (e.g. gambling addiction, social media addiction etc). If you pay attention, you might find yourself checking your phone at the slightest feeling of boredom, purely out of habit. Programmers work very hard behind the screens to keep you doing exactly that. Similar to slot machines, many apps implement a reward pattern optimized to keep you engaged as much as possible. Variable reward schedules were introduced by psychologist B.F. Skinner in the 1930s. In his experiments, he found that mice respond most frequently to reward-associated stimuli when the reward was administered after a varying number of responses, precluding the animals ability to predict when they would be rewarded. Humans are no different. 'Notification Addict' symbolizes and immortalizes the very moment of constantly checking for new notifications on one's phone; it also symbolizes the 'Variable reward schedule' discovery.

Excellence is a talent or quality which is unusually good and so surpasses ordinary standards. Achieving excellence is never easy to do. It is a quality that people really appreciate, because it's so hard to find. Excellence is the quality of excelling, of being truly the best at something. The path to achieve excellence intersects with the ability of seeing the good, risking failure, working hard, expanding, being consistent and passionate, maintaining self respect and things in balance.

Album in question was called 'If You Live The Life, Can We Die The Death?' by GrounBEEFtaxi. Album was pretty rad but was put out before any conceptual art could be added. In 1926, Graham Wallas gave the four stages of the creative process as: 1. Preparation: Building a rich pool of raw material, investigating it in all directions. 2. Digestion: Seeking a relationship between the material. 3. Incubation: Unconscious processing, using no direct effort on the process. 4. Illumination: The A-Ha moment, a flash of insight that the conscious cannot will. Not long after, in 1939, James Webb Young expanded on those stages by adding a fifth, which after the initial stage of preparation, is to Digest the material and seek the relationship. 5.Verification: Idea meets reality, a conscious and deliberate effort to test validity. 'Birth of an Idea' piece is capturing the 4th stage of Illumination, the 'A-HA' moment.

"In the Kayap language we call your money piu caprim, 'sad leaves', because it is a dead and useless thing, and it brings only harm and sadness. When your money comes into our communities it often causes big problems, driving our people apart.

Meanwhile other people starve or live in misery because they dont have enough money to get food for themselves and their children." - Raoni Metuktire Old money corrupts.

This piece highlights the feeling we have when we eat something which we shouldn't indulge into as often, while it feels very tasty, but knowing with a guilty sense that no matter what we tell ourselves, the body keeps the score and sooner or later we shall see what we are 'sowing'. A silent and long term killer, you won't even see it coming because it's always with you, by your side. Sugar causes our glucose levels to spike and plummet. An unstable blood sugar can leave you experiencing mood swings, fatigue, and headaches. It also contributes to cravings, which begin the cycle of false hunger and cravings for sweets. It affects the brain much like cocaine and alcohol, according to a brain-scan study from the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse. While you probably know that sugars can affect your body composition, they can also mess with your skin by contributing to wrinkles and sagging. After sugar hits your bloodstream, it attaches to proteins. The mix of these proteins with sugar causes the skin to lose elasticity and leads to premature aging. When were under stress, our bodies immediately kick into fight-or-flight mode, releasing large amounts of hormones. Surprisingly, the body has the same chemical response when blood sugar is low. After you eat a sweet snack, stress hormones begin to compensate for the crash by raising your blood sugar. The result? Unexplained anxiousness, irritability, and even shakiness. It increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Sugar also hides in plain sight. From sucrose, which is table sugar, to high-fructose corn syrup, which is liquid sugar, food producers have come up with a plethora of ways to list this nutrient on labels. This makes it even easier to skim over a long ingredient name in a shopping hurry and inadvertently take in more sugar than you meant to.

Well, the whole story goes even more back in the past, almost ten years before that. In 2004, during my study on the Facultad de Bellas Artes de Barcelona, I started working a small series of works, combining photoemulsion and etching. One of the works was a little bit different. Its called Vecinos (The neighbors). Living in such a big and populated city like Barcelona, I had a feeling that there was me on one side and them, all the others I dont know or I dont see, on the other side. In this work, they are neighbors posing in front of the building I was living in. This is the work that started it all, the root of MLIBTY Shadows. The shadows behind the curtains, invisible inhabitants you never meet, but you feel their presence. Characters are always in black & white, they have no hands and no legs, they are shadows with faces. MLIBTY stands for My Life Is Better Than Yours, which I take from one project I started in 2009, which deals with free distribution of an artwork, in the form of paper toys ( http://markozubak.com/mlibty).

As we come into a new millenia it seems our wondrous lady of stone has awoken, or did we wake her by accident? Solarpunk is not utopian in the negative sense of wanting to design a perfect world without any problems a outopia (no-place) but it is utopian in imagining a better world which will inspire people to create it in reality a eutopia (good-place). It sees utopia as a constant process of approximating an ideal, not reaching a light at the end of a tunnel. Solarpunk acknowledges that our utopia of social liberation and ecological stewardship may never be achieved 100%, but if we at least keep that vision in mind, throwing our efforts into making the world a bit better wherever we can, then at least every step we take towards achieving that utopia will be a step in the right direction. It will be progress, and, for those it positively impacts, liberation. As Oscar Wilde once said, A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of utopias.

An AI-assited cross-breed cyborg of Vitalik Buterin and John McAffee, doing what it do. ~~~~~~~~~~~ Based on a dream I had several months ago ~~~~~~~~~~~ Picture yourself standing on what seems like a ledge in orbit around Earth. However, you realize that ledge is connected to the ground hundred of miles below (or to the right from this vantage point). Ok wait, you're standing on the ledge parallel to the "ground?" Are we throwing basic physics out the window now? Looking out into the vastness of space, you're astonished to see what looks like a second earth not too far away. It's hard to make it out, but you see the shapes of landmasses surrounded by pure blue on this Mirror Earth, but wait... something's off. It hits you without reason and you suddenly understand that you're observing a reflection of Earth in the past. A cosmic visual illusion, a planetary mirage, the finite speed of light and its consequences has made you an observer of your soon-to-be home planet from hundreds of thousands of years in the future. You rush back through the apparent wormhole of a door that delivers you straight to the non-illusory Earth below. Why Antarctica? Of all places in the world? Antarctica? Hit with the immediate drop in temperature, you instinctively turn back to return through the door. It's gone, nowhere to be seen. Shivering, you realize you're not wearing shoes, but you feet feel numb to the ice and snow you're standing on. Looking down, you find that in fact, you don't even have feet. The new fashion statement of the century. If you're not banned from China, you're not doing the artistic expression thing right.  Loads of fun. Gan combined with drawings. Playing is the key.

Once placed in their cradles beside the station, all the seeds will dip from the station storage tanks, and they'll also start pulling in gases and liquids from the local atmosphere... ...visuals of seeds sprouting, growing like carnival balloons plumping out, becoming monstrous, making crew and warrior spaces...

His son Liet--only twelve years old, but raised in the harsh ways of the desert--ran an appraising eye over the ancient weather pod they had found in the abandoned botanical testing station. He was not confident the machine would function at all. Then Liet gazed back across the sea of dunes toward the approaching tempest. "The wind of the demon in the open desert. Hulasikali Wala." "Coriolis storm," Kynes corrected, using a scientific term instead of the Fremen one his son had selected. "Winds across the open flatlands are amplified by the planet's revolutionary motion. Gusts can reach speeds up to seven hundred kilometers per hour." As his father talked, the young man busied himself sealing the egg-shaped weather pod, checking the vent closures, the heavy doorway hatch, the stored emergency supplies. He ignored their signal generator and distress beacon; the static from the sandstorm would rip any transmissions to electromagnetic shreds. From Dune: House Harkonnen by Brian Herbert.

For some machine to be able to conjure up our whole reality, it needs to be amazingly powerful, able to keep track of an incalculable number of variables. Consider the course of just one human lifetime, with all of the events it entails, all the materials, ideas and people that one interacts with throughout an average lifespan. Then multiply that by about a hundred billion souls that have graced this planet with their presence so far. The interactions between all these people, as well as the interactions between all the animals, plants, bacterium, planetary bodies, really all the elements we know and don't know to be a part of this world, is what constitutes the reality you encounter today. Simulated reality is the hypothesis that reality could be simulated, for example by quantum computer simulation to a degree indistinguishable from 'true' reality. It could contain conscious minds which may or may not be fully aware that they are living inside a simulation.

Hal Finney - Original CypherPunk Against the Fiat Debt Machine It was 2009, I was doing glitch art even before it was called glitch art. As always I was using printer errors, xerox copy machine, analog enlarging and so on. Xerox stuff, xerox art. Found in my archives. - Here is something more from 2009 about this piece: "I collect everything... small pieces of bad prints... small stickers... photos... stuff... and after that I put all together in the xerox machine... This work is made up with some mis-prints of a work enlarged with rasterbator [://rasterbator.net/] When I enlarged a work it came up that the printer had ruined all making all the dots strange and sliced as you can see." Original physical piece is A3 format 297x420 mm. Roovel said on this piece: "Very solid effect as in -3D- There's a certain depth to it, certainly. The picture asked me to full view to go and seek these details, quite illusive. Always wondering how you make these, won't be this interesting if you tell me though." Blended together from several Deepstyles and one artbreeder image, this "Hallow Eyes" is meant as a relatively light halloween tribute, showing a grinning (?) face surrounded by circling eye creatures. I was looking for inspiration for the #artproject bleedingedgetech Halloween competition (several 666$ prizes for variants of "scariest <1min video/GIF incorporating a big Tech/Media company we love to hate" ).

Doyle tapped his finger on the table, and the startled insect flew away. Doyle... activated the HIMEMS program on the computer.

Well, the whole story goes even more back in the past, almost ten years before that. In 2004, during my study on the Facultad de Bellas Artes de Barcelona, I started working a small series of works, combining photoemulsion and etching. One of the works was a little bit different. Its called "Vecinos" (The neighbors). Living in such a big and populated city like Barcelona, I had a feeling that there was me on one side and them, all the others I dont know or I dont see, on the other side. In that work, they are neighbors posing in front of the building I was living in. It is the work that started it all, the root of MLIBTY Shadows. The shadows behind the curtains, invisible inhabitants you never meet, but you feel their presence. Characters are always in black & white, they have no hands and no legs, they are shadows with faces. MLIBTY stands for My Life Is Better Than Yours, which I take from one project I started in 2009, which deals with free distribution of an artwork, in the form of paper toys ( http://markozubak.com/mlibty). You can see the first works and the development of the project on the MLIBTY Shadows blog here: ://www.patreon.com/mlibty Boonji Project is a collection of 11,111 unique digital Non-Fungible Tokens launched on the Ethereum blockchain created by world-renowned artist Brendan Murphy.

An animated gif captures the passing events, thoughts and memories of a passing moment where a decision was made...  Gharaki took quite some time to come into their final form. I initially took a weavesilk image, passed it through Deep Style and found a symmetrical form in it... But then I decided that wasn't enough, passed THAT form through Deep Style, then cut out a small, nearly invisible pattern from THAT one, resized it from 100 pixels to 1000 (pretty much the current size) and Did some more Kaleidoscope pattern-searching, then worked it into a form I liked, animated it, and placed it on a non-symmetrical background. The non-symmetrical background is a result of how much I *love* the appearance of my Sad Stone Buddha artwork. The absence of perfect symmetry around the general shape of that artwork really brings into attention the actual form of the creature, which I think is excellent, as some of my past works have been... difficult... to separate from their backgrounds.

"The Day of the Dead (Spanish: Da de Muertos) is a Mexican holiday celebrated throughout Mexico [..], and by people of Mexican heritage elsewhere. The multi-day holiday involves family and friends gathering to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and helping support their spiritual journey. In Mexican culture, death is viewed as a natural part of the human cycle. Mexicans view it not as a day of sadness but as a day of celebration because their loved ones awake and celebrate with them."

The breakthrough has been described as a masterpiece in bioengineering, which could eventually allow scientists to grow artificial human embryos in the lab without the need for a sperm or an egg.However such work raises important ethical questions about the sanctity of human life and whether it should be manipulated or created in the lab at all. Critics warn that allowing embryos to be grown for science opens the door to designer babies and genetically modified humans. -WANTED- Known for injecting bad code into the minds of traitors.

Seas of Europa is an animated artwork I've been working on for quite some time. The animated version is still not completely finished, the overall appearance of the work is at the point where I feel that a still frame from the animation is worth publishing.

In religion and folklore, Hell is an afterlife location in which evil souls are subjected to punitive suffering, often torture as eternal punishment after death. Religions with a linear divine history often depict hells as eternal destinations, the biggest examples of which are Christianity and Islam, whereas religions with reincarnation usually depict a hell as an intermediary period between incarnations, as is the case in the dharmic religions. Religions typically locate hell in another dimension or under Earth's surface. Other afterlife destinations include Heaven, Paradise, Purgatory, Limbo, and the underworld. Other religions, which do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward, merely describe an abode of the dead, the grave, a neutral place that is located under the surface of Earth (Kur, Hades, and Sheol). Such places are sometimes equated with the English word 'hell', though a more correct translation would be 'underworld' or 'world of the dead'. The ancient Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, and Finnic religions include entrances to the underworld from the land of the living.

The United States Army conducted the first nuclear detonation on July 16, 1945, in the Jornada del Muerto desert of New Mexico. With or without irony the project was code named Trinity. The event, cited by some as the beginning of the Anthropocene, marks a profound accretion of humankinds capacity to destroy itself. On August 6, 1945, detonation of a similar device over Hiroshima, Japan, followed three days later by an additional detonation over Nagasaki, Japan, resulted in the deaths of at least 200,000 people.

The musical adaptation by Nicholas Reeves puts audiences in Bettys shoes: as if listeners turn a tuning knob on a short wave radio trying to hear Amelia Earharts distress calls that are frequently obstructed by various radio interferences.The dynamic nature of Bettys Notebook allows audiences to uncover chilling distress signals and key clues by toggling variants within different stems. The ever evolving music creates a holistic picture of the eternal mystery of Amelia Earhart.

A shot I took in the decentralized blockchain world 'CryptoVoxels' before beginning the build of the very first Vaporwave(music genre) Virtual Plaza. The music genre itself is a paradox in the music world, some have called it simply downpitched 80's muzak whereas another view has come to terms that it isn't about the music but moreso the art that supplants the music. The biggest and most exciting artistic debate in the music field I believe has been in this 'Vaporware' genre of music, which inherently spawned from only one place.....the internet itself. This is an experiment in VR photography and documenting possibly the biggest shift in entertainment and the arts in human history. Photographic document of one of the most innovative artistic events in Los Angeles. A bridge between the virtual and analogue, an art show that will bridge two worlds and effectively be global and yet street scene wise at the same time. While this VR show will take place, the other 'human' version will be taking place in Downtown Los Angeles at the same time.

The public address of the wallet is: 13P3m4paqsBRSUWogY74QLSFfJMFXwx4yq The collector can use Terminal to extract the key like so "unzip 2Moon.gif". Windows users can also use WinRAR to decompress the zip (just rename the gif to zip upfront). To prevent the funds from being stolen, the buyer will need a password to unzip.

This will, in turn, affect our judgment about life. A mindset constrained by fear and unwillingness is the worst you can have to embrace change and individuality. Opening your mind to the many possibilities is the best way to evaluate your probable talent. Talents exist in many parameters of life, from class work, artistic designs, athletics, and events to the other complex areas of life. Sometimes we deceive ourselves and set non-factual limits in our own lives. Sometimes we believe to be the best of the best in some of the things we do but only too late to realize that we were wrong. Owning the art of rightful and mindful prioritization is all you need to push you through the new exercise. Some of the things we have been shying away from are the very things we are good at. Life can shock you if you are not prepared to counter the effect. Learn to build confidence in every stage of life, take reasonable risks and learn more. Reflecting on your past. A simple yet very effective way to find your forgotten natural gifts. This will give you the sense to appreciate the previous you; the success, weakness, and unsolved challenges. The interests you once had while you were a young kid could have a great influence on your current and future self. Take a test and try to identify your childhood interests, the things you enjoyed and loved the most.Reflect the same on your previous success and failures. Hard work is the other name for success. And yes, hard work can beat talent if talent fails to work hard. Talents can come naturally or through persistent practice but to keep it rocking, good amount of effort is essential. Practice will never be complete without knowing your weakness and this will differentiate the quality of output from quantity. Working smart has hard work in it balanced with proper timing and persistence in achieving the goals of life. Success comes shortly after challenges and failure by itself a justification for the lack of hard work and persistence in life. You need to take various challenges and proceed to the next level after a struggle to realize what you really belong to. Working on your weakness is not as easy. Thats why a self-rewarding system should be set to push you through the trials in life and propagates you towards achieving the talent in your dreams. Finding your true talents in life is and will never be an easy task. However, dont let the obstacles deter you from even starting your journey. It might be a life long journey to some. And there will be hard work. But I assure you that it will be a very exciting journey! We recently studied the Greeks and read the Iliad and the adventures of Achilles and Odysseus.

The code has been written in R by Fronkonstin (@aschinchon). The TSP asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" TSP is one of the most studied questions in computer science. It is known to be NP-hard, meaning that it is very unlikely that there exists an efficient solution for it. This is in fact related to the most famous open question in computer science, the P vs NP conjecture. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute, each of which carries a US $1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution. Wanna try?

Started this piece with the idea of a monument to a poet, but during the working process, stumbled upon a poem by Simon Armitage called "Conquistadors", which adds in particular way to the previous piece, MLIBTY Conquistador (://superrare.co/artwork-v2/mlibty-giants-series:-mlibty-conquistador-5023). His poem is a commemoration of the 1969 moon landing, which compares the US astronauts to the Spanish explorers who conquered the Americas in the 16th century. This is the fourth piece from the MLIBTY GIANTS series. The series is inspired by the public sculptures to the "great" people and connects art on blockchain and physical art, which means that the statue from this piece exists as real miniature sculpture, (dimensions: 24 x 24 x 68 mm, weight: 42g, materials: travertine, white cement, gauze, acrylic paint, transparent coating). FIRST SALE NOTICE: For a minimum bid of 1 ETH, you'll get an extra Codex Record (CD) token, TokenID 91946], as proof of ownership for the figurine, while the shipping of physical object will be for free. ------------------------ I started MLIBTY Shadows sculpture series at the beginning of 2013, after I had this idea in my head already for some while. Well, the whole story goes even more back in the past, almost ten years before that. In 2004, during my study on the Facultad de Bellas Artes de Barcelona, I started working a small series of works, combining photoemulsion and etching. One of the works was a little bit different. Its called "Vecinos" (The neighbors). Living in such a big and populated city like Barcelona, I had a feeling that there was me on one side and them, all the others I dont know or I dont see, on the other side. In that work, they are neighbors posing in front of the building I was living in. It is the work that started it all, the root of MLIBTY Shadows. The shadows behind the curtains, invisible inhabitants you never meet, but you feel their presence. Characters are always in black & white, they have no hands and no legs, they are shadows with faces. MLIBTY stands for My Life Is Better Than Yours, which I take from one project I started in 2009, which deals with free distribution of an artwork, in the form of paper toys ( http://markozubak.com/mlibty). You can see the first works and the development of the project on the MLIBTY Shadows blog here: ://www.patreon.com/mlibty Exclusively on SuperRare, only 1 Edition to ever exist.

"During the twilight years of this century, I believe humans will be unrecognizable in morphology and dynamics from what we are today," Herr says. "Humanity will take flight and soar."

I find so significant this post that I wanted to immortalize it with an artwork because it marks the emergence of a secondary market and in particular the belief that Cryptoart can become a movement that will make art history.

I remember watching the first time Ethereum was presented at the Bitcoin 2014 Miami conference when the Bitcoin maximalists were still arguing about the whose money was lost at the Mt. Gox exchange. I was in L.A at the time and I could see back then that Vitalik Buterin had a keen foresight to blockchain technology's advancement and only some were catching it. This very description and artistic application is proof positive that Ethereum is a wonderful, working and ever expanding invention. Thanks Mr. Buterin and cheers to the future.

Life - the ocean The ocean of life is a vast expanse for small children. Nobody knows what it will bring, which ships will cross its path and which weather it will bring. Wishing someone only blue skies and calm seas for his life would not be a good wish. Bad weather and also storms are part of life and are sometimes the greatest chances to grow as a human being. And every human being should get the chance to be a light in the life of some people. --------------- Das Leben - der Ozean Der Ozean des Lebens ist fr kleine Kinder noch eine groe Weite. Niemand wei, was er einem Menschen bringen wird, welche Schiffe seinen Weg kreuzen werden und welches Wetter er bringen wird. Jemandem nur blauen Himmel und ruhige See fr sein Leben zu wnschen, wre kein guter Wunsch. Schlechtes Wetter und auch Strme gehren zum Leben dazu und sind manchmal die grten Chancen, um als Mensch zu wachsen. Und jeder Mensch sollte in seinem Leben die Chance bekommen, dem Einen oder Anderen ein Licht in dessen Leben zu sein. Calm. From the rudder blade drips the evening sky.

As I was creating this piece an odd occurrence happened. I morphed our wonderful and humble subject Dorian Nakamoto(to which Newsweek misreported as being the creator of Bitcoin) through various figures and landed on my interpretation of Shakespeare. The odd occurrence is primarily due to the fact that the story of Shakespeare and the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto are linked dramatically in more ways than one. Shakespeare's identity has always been a topic in the dramatic art world and of course Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has been a constant drama that has lasted for a decade. Also they both were seminal at creating world defining works that changed the landscape of human civilization. The interesting point at hand is while working with artificial intelligence tools and yet guiding it generation by generation, I still feel the mystical force of art creation taking part and that this could possibly be a piece that was meant to be expressed. From Satoshi to Shakespeare, identities are what they appear to be....or not be. This is my third foldable rubberstamp artwork. Water based inks on tracing paper.

But in some cases, rarely, a motif appears. d: And is it interesting? B: Nothing that can distract us from the patenting fight, of course. But it's always the same motif, it's somewhat upsetting. Q: Can you tell me what it is? B: Look, this is it: . Probably it is an artifact, but it strongly remembers a drawing, or a fragment of word. d: And what does it mean? B: Frankly, we don't know yet.

The character's body features composites of images used in some of the most renowned public relations campaigns created and directly influenced by Bernays. The backdrop behind the character was created using a composite of images of many different types of crowds, to symbolize "the crowd", who, by an overwhelming majority are not participating in bitcoin. The PR man's line of sight symbolizes his area of focus, the crowd of pre-coiners. Beyond the threshold of this line of sight is the dimension of the bitcoiners. Here, the bitcoin price chart is shown in an area separated by subections delineated with dotted lines (i.e. trend lines). The subsections contain artwork depicting sentiments of market participants associated with a break out of bitcoin's price into each section. The PR man says "Buy bitcoin".

I submitted to Blair Renaud, developer of 'Low-Fi' a virtual reality game based in a Cyberpunk world. Not %100 certain if it's gonna make it in the game but it's in development as we speak. I am submitting this to break the rules of what is currently known both in the art world and the music world. To fuse both mediums into one fine art aspect and be a concrete and rareified artistic medium in its own right. I present this piece as a truly objectified piece of artwork, that is both music and art at the very same time. The song is available for free to enjoy on Bandcamp, the visual element that you see here however.....is up to bid as a completion to the art piece as a whole.

Lesson....Only listen to yourself. - An aPNG animation study of geometry, space, and color inspired by reactions to the recent Telsa truck release. This piece highlights an artistic expression of our bodies degradation. Art can be seen in both creation and destruction, art does not judge, unlike its observer. We eat thing which we shouldn't indulge into as often, while it feels very tasty, we know with a guilty sense that no matter what we tell ourselves, the body keeps the score and sooner or later we shall see what we are 'sowing'. A silent and long term killer, you won't even see it coming because it's always with you, by your side. Sugar causes our glucose levels to spike and plummet. An unstable blood sugar can leave you experiencing mood swings, fatigue, and headaches. It also contributes to cravings, which begin the cycle of false hunger and cravings for sweets. It affects the brain much like cocaine and alcohol, according to a brain-scan study from the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse. While you probably know that sugars can affect your body composition, they can also mess with your skin by contributing to wrinkles and sagging. After sugar hits your bloodstream, it attaches to proteins. The mix of these proteins with sugar causes the skin to lose elasticity and leads to premature aging. When were under stress, our bodies immediately kick into fight-or-flight mode, releasing large amounts of hormones. Surprisingly, the body has the same chemical response when blood sugar is low. After you eat a sweet snack, stress hormones begin to compensate for the crash by raising your blood sugar. The result? Unexplained anxiousness, irritability, and even shakiness. It increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Sugar also hides in plain sight. From sucrose, which is table sugar, to high-fructose corn syrup, which is liquid sugar, food producers have come up with a plethora of ways to list this nutrient on labels. This makes it even easier to skim over a long ingredient name in a shopping hurry and inadvertently take in more sugar than you meant to.

Originally painted in black on 55 x 37 acrylic canvas, this is the inverted digital variant of "Coded Vision" I visited, studied, sketched, made notes from, and and drew inspiration from photographed works at The Art Institute of Chicago. This research allowed me to create digitally rendered master copies after the works in Gallery 243, also known as The Monet Room. The master copy is a tradition in art in which a student artist creates a copy from a masterpiece in order to analyze and learn from the work. I create master copies in order to train myself to use the custom graphics software I've programmed, in addition to spurring the building of tools especially to meet the challenge of creating analogs to particular techniques. I've designed my software to leverage algorithms with my own human input. I build paintings layer by layer, making choices regarding color, shape, form, and how the algorithms I've written should interact at any particular time. The result is my ability to communicate in color and pattern in ways I long understood but which are too complex, time consuming, or cost prohibitive for my hand and materials to manifest physically with traditional methods.

I took this picture in Kizkumu and edited digitally back in 2018. Kizkumu is an area of 600 meters shallow water that divides this bay of Turkey. According to the legend, a girl who wants to reach her lover fills her skirt with sand and start moving ahead in the sea by filling the sea with her sand. But she was drowned when she ran out of sand. Just at the beginning point of the shallow water area, there is a sculpture of this girl. Inspired by a collaboration between David Byrne and Twyla Tharp. Byrne told the Times: "This has been a real collaboration. The way I work, recording basic tracks with just a few instruments and then building layers of rhythm and texture on top of that, lent itself to the way we were able to work together." This echoes my own creative process, and the spirit of collaboration I've found in the crypto art space.  What we all wait for. What we all love. The art after the load Blob.

Long ago, I promised myself that I'd take a stab at religious motifs when my skill could only pose a compliment to the subject. This painting is based on a french postcard from the turn of the century. It was the practice of many photographers at the time to hire prostitutes for these commercial photographs. Given that, I wondered if this was indeed the woman's child. The closeness seems too natural to be staged. And did the child grow up knowing his father or had he been forsaken?

Whenever she spewed it out again, it bubbled and seethed in turmoil like a cauldron on a vast fire, and high overhead the spray rained down on the crags on either side. When she swallowed the seas, her inner vortex could be seen, and the rock echoed savagely round about, while below the seabed showed its dark-blue sand."

As part of my series of re-imaginings, I present a more evolved and nuanced interpretation. In the iconic image of Hero vs HAL, the spaceman has morphed into Elon looking toward 2021 as the signal degrades, perhaps indicating that things did not go so well this time around.. I really enjoyed making this piece. Both digital work and painting. Before this one was a painting. And before painting was digital image, to be put in the painting. It was in 2010. when I painted this big painting, "Almacn viejo" mixed media on canvas, 200200 cm. Back then, MLIBTY shadows weren't born yet, at least not as they are seen today. Many details in this piece were photographed on fish boats. It is impressive how much fish are constantly being taken out of the sea. Seems that one day only fishermen's shadows will remain. MLIBTY Shadows are no ghosts. MLIBTY Shadows represent people. Characters are always in black & white, they have no hands and no legs, they are shadows with faces. MLIBTY stands for My Life Is Better Than Yours, which I take from one project I started in 2009, which deals with free distribution of an artwork, in the form of paper toys ( http://markozubak.com/mlibty). Check out the MLIBTY Shadows blog here: ://www.patreon.com/mlibty   This is part of an abstract series where I experiment with enclosed gradient/radiance and interpret time spread in a larger galactic sync. This piece here, although not intentional turned into what resembles a cross and the planetary points that I made miraculously turned into the nail points on the cross of Christ. I will deem this religious art in the fact that I cannot avoid the symbolism therein. It is still abstract futurism but consider this a theologian piece as well if you wish. The other pieces are located at other notable blockchain galleries as well. The Pentland Experiment is an on-going project which depicts an alternative reality on the outskirts of Edinburgh. Using electronic techniques, which converge the digital and physical, Harman creates abstracted motifs within sparse landscapes. Figures and structures are deliberately burred from the viewer in these highly staged algorithmic compositions. Within the corruption of the digital, there is a break up of information, which leaves the viewer flickering between abstraction and figuration TANSTAAFL We infiltrate the banking sector and take our lives into our own hands.

Any quantum system in which a physical property can take on only discrete values is said to be quantized. For instance, the energy of a confined particle is quantized. This is in contrast to a situation in which the energy can vary continuously, which is the case for a free particle. A field of shimmering Amethyst crystal captured with glorious stereoscopic 3D photography. Single Edition Hi-Res GIF by Sarah Zucker. This piece represents a cornucopia of concepts for me: it's about sexuality, consent, pleasure, pain, post-2017-spirituality, reclamation of experience, memory, surfing through the catalog of past moments, [re]appropriation (of even one's own art), the relationship between online and offline art +multi-neuro-glitch!
