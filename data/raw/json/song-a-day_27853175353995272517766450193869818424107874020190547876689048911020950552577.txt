sound\n \n break upon the backs of stale frustration\n \n and citizens wake up at the sensation\u00ac\u2020\n \n rub their eyes\n \n \n \n no melody or words\n \n could have cut quite like the sword\n \n swung by the hand of evolution\n \n to live and grow and die\n \n without ever knowing why\n \n knowing how to ask but finding no solution\n \n calling it divine retribution\n \n cut the cords\n \n

\n \n \n i was on my way to school\n \n i saw her cross the street\n \n and her power sent out waves upon the pavement\n \n i pulled over then and there\n \n i had to catch my breath\n \n and stare in this delicate amazement\u00ac\u2020\n \n i felt utterly exposed, stripped naked\n \n to the bone\n \n \n \n when she came up to the car\n \n and asked, \"\"do you know where we are?\"\"\n \n i couldn't tell if she was serious or joking\n \n i tried to say yes\n \n and planet earth, i guess\n \n but the sounds out of my mouth were more like choking\n \n in the distance some peeper frogs were croaking\n \n to the moon\n \n \n \n we were married\n \n it was the first of may\n \n and i carried her and she carried me\n \n the entire way\n \n it was scary\n \n but it was the best day of my life\n \n \n \n in my house there is a room\u00ac\u2020\n \n and in that room there is a drawer\n \n and in that drawer is a list of all my worries\n \n it's an illustrated list\n \n with notes an annotations\n \n and entries like nature's wrath and fury\n \n and brain aneurysms from being in a hurry\n \n i eat too fast\n \n \n \n sometimes i go to sleep\u00ac\u2020\n \n thinking i'll never wake\n \n is it only in my mind these thoughts are turning\n \n or do i die every night\n \n to be revived by the light\n \n of the tower in the clouds softly burning\n \n and the pitter patter of the rain finally returning\n \n as it hits the glass\n \n \n \n out the window\n \n the sky is overcast\n \n if i could fly i'd follow birds\n \n on their lonely paths\n \n but i swallow all my pills\n \n and am fading fast\u00ac\u2020\n \n close my eyes\n \n \n \n i find the space between\n \n wakefulness and sleep\u00ac\u2020\n \n is the very best time for free association\n \n and most of my ideas\n \n the ones i throw away and keep\n \n come in the shower between exfoliations\u00ac\u2020\n \n not on the mountain top in mediation\n \n no not at all\n \n \n \n jesus said that money\u00ac\u2020\n \n and religion didn't mix\n \n and so they built corporate mega churches\n \n jesus said that being poor\n \n was the the only way to live\n \n and so we arrest the homeless like they're walking curses\n \n we cast them out as if there were nothing worse\n \n than being poor\n \n \n \n there's no space there\n \n for interpretation\n \n it's an amazing case of blind\n \n
