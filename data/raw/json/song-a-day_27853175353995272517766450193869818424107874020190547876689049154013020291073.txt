A Day #722", "description": "\n \n \n \n i woke up from a party and looked in to the mirror\n \n and what i saw staring back filled me up with fear\n \n i had a treasure map plastered on my forehead\n \n i knew not how i got it must have been when i was in bed\n \n \n \n it seemed to lead me to this tree in a field nearby\n \n i walked there with no shoes on because i didn't have any\n \n i had lost them at the party anyway when i got to the tree\n \n there was a gremlin like creature waiting for me\n \n \n \n who dare disturbs me the gremlin creature said\n \n disturbs you i exclaimed i have this map on my forehead\n \n he examined me closely and then took me by the hand\n \n he touched a piece of bark and the tree split in half\n \n \n \n hidden within the tree was a door made out of glass\n \n he led me through it and we appeared in a great hall\n \n there were fantastic creatures every which way i looked\n \n this faerie looking woman came and kissed me on my map\n \n \n \n at the end of the hall sat a king looking old and wise\n \n he told me that the map was just a hoax \n \n he said i should probably just turn around and go back now\n \n because there wasn't anything in this world for me anyhow\n \n \n \n no i yelled forcefully which made everyone jump a bit\n \n no i said softer i'm happy to have found this place\n \n the faerie looking woman was looking kind but sort of sad\n \n ok said the king we were afraid you would say that\n \n \n \n next thing i knew i was in a gladiatorial arena\n \n there was big dragon there and an ostrich for me to ride\n \n i picked up my sword and hopped aboard and slayed the dragon quick as ice\n \n a booming voice came from above and it said very nice\n \n \n \n the voice was god and god was glad that i had slayed the dragon\n \n he rewarded me with anything that my little heart desired\n \n to be back in bed i said before the party started\n \n but i want to bring the faeire back because i think she's really cool\n \n \n \n \"\"How about a song about a guy who\u00d4\u00aa\u00f8 wakes up after a party to find a treasure map drawn on the back of his head?\"\"\"", "external_link":
